TORONTO — The Rays are set for a long day of baseball, playing a split doubleheader in Toronto, with first pitches at 12:07 and 6:07. Ace Shane McClanahan will be starting the opener for the Rays; assuming he delivers another strong start, that should minimize use of their bullpen. That could be a factor for the second game, as Drew Rasmussen is returning to action after being sidelined since June 15 with a left hamstring strain. He threw only three innings of live batting practice Monday as prep. The Rays lost the first two games of the series, which was expanded to include the doubleheader to make up for games lost due to the lockout. The Rays made several roster moves this morning: • Reliever David McKay, who had a rough Rays debut in Friday’s loss, was optioned to Triple-A. • Dusten Knight, another right-hander, was activated, having already been in Toronto as a member of the taxi squad. • Rasmussen was activated as the 27th man for the day, then will have to be formally added to the roster and someone else dropped after the second game. • Reliever Cristofer Ogando was summoned from Triple-A Durham to join the taxi squad. Also of note: the Rays said Shane Baz will start Sunday’s series finale. Jeffrey Springs, who didn’t make the trip to Toronto due to a family medical emergency, could rejoin the team in Boston. Cash said he will decide after the day’s first game which players are able to also play in the second; Kevin Kiermaier and Wander Franco, who both recently returned from the injured list, seem unlikely to be in the field for both games. Here is the Rays’ lineup for Game 1 of the doubleheader: And for the Blue Jays: • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
