Before it moves into its new Tampa headquarters, Primo Water Corp. is expanding its reach in the Southeast. The water distribution company announced Monday that it has acquired Atlanta-area company Highland Mountain Water, which distributes Primo’s Mountain Valley brand. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. “With more than 2,500 customers and a service area that includes a population of more than 4 million residents, Highland Mountain Water will fit seamlessly into the Primo family and align with our mission of inspiring healthier lives through better quality water,” Primo Water CEO Tom Harrington said in a statement. Harrington said the acquisition would grow the Mountain Valley brand within Primo’s primary distribution footprint. Primo sells and services water products like self-serve dispensers in more than 20,000 locations around the country and provides filtration products in more than 20 countries. It has 9,200 employees and 2.6 million customers worldwide. The company reported revenues of more than $2 billion in 2021. In November, Primo announced it would exit the single-use bottled water market in an effort to save money and reduce its impact on the environment — but Mountain Valley, which is distributed in glass bottles, was not impacted. The company also announced it would be relocating its Tampa headquarters to a new office building in Midtown Tampa, the new $1 billion mixed-use development off Interstate 275 and N Dale Mabry Highway.
