ST. PETERSBURG — After a lost weekend in Cincinnati, the Rays returned to Tropicana Field tonight to face the Red Sox and got the expected news that shortstop Wander Franco will undergo surgery Tuesday to remove and repair a broken hamate bone in his right hand. He is expected to miss five to eight weeks. Manager Kevin Cash also said that centerfielder Kevin Kiermaier will see a specialist after the All-Star break to address recurring issues with his left hip and will “be down for some time.” On the plus side, second baseman Brandon Lowe (low back) will continue his rehab with Triple-A Durham with the possibility he could return as soon as Saturday. Reliever Pete Fairbanks will throw for Durham on Wednesday and Thursday and also could return the weekend before the All-Star break. Of note on other injury updates, Cash said pitchers Yonny Chirinos (Tommy John surgery) and Brendan McKay (thoracic outlet syndrome surgery) will pitch in a Florida Complex League game on Saturday. The Rays took two of three from the Red Sox in Boston last week; the return matchup at the Trop is a four-game set. The Rays are using Matt Wisler as an opener tonight, with lefty Josh Fleming expected to work bulk innings. The Sox are starting Brayan Bello, who made his debut against the Rays on Wednesday. Boston manager Alex Cora confirmed that lefty Chris Sale will make his season debut on Tuesday. Here is the Rays lineup with Jonathan Aranda and Luke Raley, who were called up after Franco and Kiermaier were injured Saturday, getting to start: And for the Red Sox: • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
