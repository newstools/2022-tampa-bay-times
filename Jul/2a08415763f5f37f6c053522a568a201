When the XFL returns in February, Tampa Bay won’t have a team. It wasn’t among the eight places announced Sunday as having teams for the league’s third iteration. In 2020, the XFL had teams in the New York, Los Angeles and Tampa Bay areas, but they had lackluster attendance. Those markets accounted for the five lowest-attended games of the 20 that were played that year. Next year, teams will be in Orlando; Arlington, Texas; Houston; Las Vegas; San Antonio, Texas; Seattle; St. Louis, and Washington. The Orlando team will be coached by former FSU and NFL cornerback Terrell Buckley and play at Camping World Stadium. Other coaches include Rod Woodson (Las Vegas), Hines Ward (San Antonio), Bob Stoops (Arlington) and former Bucs tight end Anthony Becht (St. Louis). The XFL season will kick off on Feb. 18. Games will be broadcast exclusively via a combination of ABC, ESPN networks and FX. Tickets can be purchased at xfl.com/tickets.
