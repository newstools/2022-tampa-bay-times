After a relatively dry Tuesday, afternoon and evening showers are expected to return to the Tampa Bay area Wednesday with some being potentially heavy. Meanwhile, a disturbance that forecasters have been tracking in the northern Gulf of Mexico could drench areas from the Florida Panhandle to Louisiana today and through the rest of the week. Forecasters have been tracking that patch of rough weather since the weekend and at one point they gave it about a 20 percent chance of strengthening into a tropical system. But in its 8 a.m. advisory on Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said the chances of strengthening are about zero. Still, the disturbance could whip some rain into the northern Gulf Coast and flash flooding is possible, forecasters said. In the Tampa Bay area, Spectrum Bay News 9 says rain chances today will be 40 percent. The high will be a steamy 93. Rain chances increase to 60 percent on Thursday and into the weekend, which will clip the daytime highs a bit to the upper 80s to low 90s. Overnight lows will be in the high 70s. • • • 2022 Tampa Bay Times Hurricane Guide IT'S STORM SEASON: Get ready and stay informed at tampabay.com/hurricane. RISING THREAT: Tampa Bay will flood.
