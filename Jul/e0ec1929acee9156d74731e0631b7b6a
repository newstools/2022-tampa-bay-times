Looking for offbeat theater experiences? The Tampa Fringe Festival has you covered. Now in its sixth year, the festival brings indie performances including improv, burlesque, comedy, clowns and shows for kids to three venues at Hillsborough Community College’s Ybor City Performing Arts Building (1411 E 11th Ave.) July 28-Aug. 7. Show titles like “Oh Gasparella!,” “Lockdown” and “Spooky and Gay Cabaret” give a sense of the varied experiences. What’s more, folks who’d like to get a sampling of the acts can see 15 locals on July 27 and eight touring acts on Aug. 3, all for free in the Rehearsal Hall. The Kids Fringe includes two shows, “A Goofy Musical” and “The Everglads.” Tickets for those shows are free for kids and $10 for adults, but free with the presentation of a SNAP or WIC card. In addition to the shows, there will be free activities for kids including story time and outdoor performances by acrobatic group Acrobellum. More activities for kids happen at Fringe Central, in the performing arts building. This year’s festival has a Peace, Love, Fringe! theme and features 23 companies performing nearly 100 shows during 10 days. Individual tickets and packages, as well as a full schedule of shows, are available at tampafringe.org.
