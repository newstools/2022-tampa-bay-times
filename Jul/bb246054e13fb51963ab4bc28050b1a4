It’s a big day for Republicans in Florida as former President Donald Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis headline two conferences on opposing coasts Saturday evening. The Republican Party of Florida is holding its Sunshine Summit this weekend at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino near Hollywood, where DeSantis will be featured during an evening dinner. And Turning Point USA, an organization for conservative youth and young adults, is gathering in Tampa, where Trump will speak. Trump is eyeing a 2024 campaign for president. DeSantis is running for reelection in Florida, but is widely considered a possible 2024 contender. DeSantis made opening remarks Saturday morning at the state party summit, and according to a published schedule will be speaking again around 6:30 p.m., along with U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez. Apart from the governor’s appearance, several primary debates were held for Congressional Districts 4, 7, 13 and 15. The conference also features break-out sessions, such as Sports Go Woke and the Nation Suffers, with Clay Travis. Over in Tampa, Turning Point USA, an organization for conservative youth and young adults, is holding the Student Action Summit, a three-day event that began Friday. Several notable conservative figures are slated to make an appearance and speak, including Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, Congresswoman Lauren Boebert and Congressman Matt Gaetz. DeSantis was a featured speaker on the opening evening. Trump will be the bookend to the summit’s second day, scheduled to come on stage after 6:30 p.m., as DeSantis leads the state Republican Party’s dinner hundreds of miles away.
