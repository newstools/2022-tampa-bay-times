KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Rays have eight left-handed swingers in the starting lineup tonight against Royals righty Brady Singer. Five are true lefties: Brandon Lowe, Luke Raley, Ji-Man Choi, Josh Lowe and Brett Phillips. Three are switch-hitters: Taylor Walls, Francisco Mejia and newly acquired Roman Quinn, who will make his first start. The Rays are leaning left for a reason: Singer has limited right-handed hitters to a .254 average and .657 OPS, while lefties have hit .271 against him and have an .845 OPS. Luis Patino is making his second start for the Rays since being activated following a three-month injury absence due to an oblique strain and then a blister issue on his right middle finger. Patino will take the mound tonight with his hair dyed blue, a tribute to injured teammate and fellow Colombian Harold Ramirez, who wore his hair with a blue hue. The Rays will enter play a season-high-matching 11 games over .500 at 52-41 and holding the top AL wild-card spot. The weather again will be a factor, with a heat advisory in effect and temperatures in triple digits and the feels-like during the afternoon as high as 105. Singer is a University of Florida product; Walls played at FSU.
