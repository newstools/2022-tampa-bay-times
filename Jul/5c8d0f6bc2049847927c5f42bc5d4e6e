ST. PETERSBURG — The Rays are set to play their final game before the All-Star break and will have right-hander Pete Fairbanks in the bullpen for the first time this season. Fairbanks, out since a lat strain in spring training, was activated this morning. To make room on the 26-man active roster, lefty Jalen Beeks was placed on the injured list due to right lower leg tightness, a similar issue that earlier sidelined lefty Jeffrey Springs. Manager Kevin Cash said they are expecting a minimal injured list stay for Beeks, and that Springs is likely to be activated post-break and start in Kansas City. To make room for Fairbanks on the 40-man roster, Triple-A reliever Dusten Knight designated for assignment. The Rays will have Corey Kluber on the mound today; the O’s are starting righty Jordan Lyles. The Rays are without two of their top hitters: Yandy Diaz, who was hit on the left forearm by a pitch Saturday and still sore and swollen Sunday, and Ji-Man Choi, who Cash said he has been playing a lot and would benefit from a day off, albeit ahead of the four-day break. Cash did acknowledge that with plans to use Brandon Lowe at DH and wanting to play Harold Ramirez it was a bit tricky to assemble the lineup. Both Choi and Diaz are available off the bench.
