The University of South Florida announced Tuesday that it surpassed $150 million in fundraising during its 2021-22 fiscal year, the most in its 70-year history. The $151.8 million came from more than 34,000 donors, including over 6,300 who were giving for the first time, according to a news release. The donations included $23 million for an indoor training athletic facility, $10 million to go toward an on-campus stadium, $14 million to establish a financial technology program, $5.6 million to USF Health and $10.6 million for a career and training center for business students. The total also included more than $16 million for scholarships — up 45% from last year, the release said. “Our university has a history of setting ambitious goals and surpassing expectations,” USF president Rhea Law said in the release. The university’s board of trustees hired Law earlier this year in part because of her answers during the interview process on cultivating relationships with donors. USF Foundation chairperson Jose Valiente, who served on the university’s presidential search committee, said the donations will go beyond its campuses to help the region at large. “By giving to USF, donors are helping more and more students succeed, which ultimately strengthens Tampa Bay and the greater community,” Valiente said in the release. “The continued generosity of USF donors will further unlock the limitless potential of this great university.”
