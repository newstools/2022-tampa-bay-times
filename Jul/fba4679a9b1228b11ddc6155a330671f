The Florida Panhandle and other parts of the Gulf Coast could get heavy rain this week because of a rough patch of weather that is spilling into the Gulf of Mexico. The weather stems from a “decaying frontal boundary” that is now over the southeastern United States but that will move offshore into the Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center said in its 2 a.m. advisory Monday. “Some slow development of this system is possible if it remains offshore during the middle and latter part of the week while it moves little,” the advisory states. “Regardless of development, heavy rains will be possible along portions of the northern Gulf coast from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle over the next several days.” Forecasters give the system only a 30 percent chance of tropical formation by the weekend. • • • 2022 Tampa Bay Times Hurricane Guide IT'S STORM SEASON: Get ready and stay informed at tampabay.com/hurricane.
