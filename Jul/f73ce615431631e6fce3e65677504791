BRANDON — The Lightning found their replacement for assistant coach Derek Lalonde on Tuesday, hiring former Red Wings head coach Jeff Blashill. Detroit hired Lalonde as the franchise’s new head coach at the end of June, leaving a vacancy on Tampa Bay’s staff. Blashill, 48, coached in Detroit from 2015-16 to 2021-22. At the end of the regular season, Red Wings general manager Steve Yzerman, who led Tampa Bay’s front office until 2018, did not renew his contract. Detroit has missed the playoffs in six of the past seven seasons. The Lightning’s assistant coaching staff now includes: Blashill, Rob Zettler, Jeff Halpern, goaltending coach Frantz Jean and video coaches Nigel Kirwan and Brian Garlock. Before joining the Red Wings as their head coach, Blashill spent three seasons with the AHL’s Grand Rapids, winning the Calder Cup championship with the Griffins in his first year as head coach in 2012-13. In 2011-12, he served as an assistant on Detroit’s staff. Contact Mari Faiello at mfaiello@tampabay.com.
