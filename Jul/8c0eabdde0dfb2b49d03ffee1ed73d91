As we endure a sizzling summer, the pool and that warm Gulf of Mexico don’t even offer relief. So if you just want to submit to the joys of that sweet, sweet air-conditioning, here are our favorite spots to take a respite without breaking the bank. For the kids MOSI: Tampa’s Museum of Science and Industry lets kids and parents alike play with science experiments like pedaling a bicycle on a cable suspended 30 feet above the ground, lying on a bed of nails and engineering a moon base. The museum has been invaded by dinosaurs this summer thanks to a blockbuster animatronic exhibit. Dinosaurs Around the World, which has broken attendance records at science museums in the U.S. and Europe since it launched in 2017, features more than a dozen lifelike animatronic dinosaurs that offer a paleontological journey back in time. It runs through Labor Day and is included with admission. 10 a.m.-5 p.m. daily. $12.95, $10.95 seniors, $7.95 ages 2-12. Parking is free. 4801 E Fowler Ave., Tampa. 813-987-6000. mosi.org.

See a movie Movies got their start as the first air-conditioned spaces in the 1930s. Tampa Theatre was built in 1926 when movie houses were palatial. And this one was more palatial than most, with its statutes of gargoyles and exotic birds and a realistic night sky above, plus twinkling stars and ornate architecture designed to make you feel like you are in a moonlit courtyard. Tampa Theatre is running a Summer Classics film series that will include “The Godfather” and “Blazing Saddles,” which you can enjoy on the big screen in the A/C with some popcorn. Films are $10 at the box office, $12 online at tampatheatre.org. 711 N Franklin St., Tampa. Open noon-5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Take in some art Simultaneously soak up culture and the cool air.
