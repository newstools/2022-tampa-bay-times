A driver swerved across a median on U.S. 19 in Pasco County late Friday night, causing a crash that killed her passenger and injured two others, authorities said. About 10:57 p.m., the driver — a 27-year-old Hudson woman — was heading south on the highway in a sedan. Her passenger was a 23-year-old woman from New Port Richey. Neither was wearing a seatbelt, according to a Florida Highway Patrol news release. Troopers said the driver lost control north of Eden Avenue and crossed the median in front of another sedan traveling north. The cars crashed, and the passenger died at the scene, the agency reported. Injuries to the driver were minor. In the second car, the driver, a 36-year-old woman from Pennsylvania, and two passengers, a 63-year-old woman from New York and a 38-year-old man from Pennsylvania, suffered serious injuries. All three were wearing seatbelts, troopers said. The agency did not release the names of any of the people involved in the crash.
