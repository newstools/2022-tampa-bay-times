MONTREAL — Former NHL defenseman Bryan Marchment died unexpectedly Wednesday in Montreal, his agent said. He was 53. Longtime agent Rick Curran confirmed Marchment’s death to The Associated Press. Marchment was attending the NHL draft in Montreal as a scout for the San Jose Sharks, with whom he played for parts of six seasons. A cause of death was not immediately available. The Lightning acquired Marchment from the Oilers in a December 1997 trade that saw Roman Hamrlik, Tampa Bay’s first-ever pick (and first overall in the 1992 draft) go to Edmonton. Marchment played 22 games with the Lightning in 1997-98 before he was sent to the Sharks in a March 1998 deal that brought Tampa Bay the rights to the pick it ultimately used to select Vinny Lecavalier. Marchment also played with Winnipeg, Chicago, Hartford, Colorado, Toronto and Calgary during a 17-season NHL career that stretched from 1989-2006. The Scarborough, Ontario native, had been working in scouting and other roles for the Sharks and their American Hockey League affiliate since 2007. • • • Sign up for Lightning Strikes, a weekly newsletter from Bolts beat writer Eduardo A.
