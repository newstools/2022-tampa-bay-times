Tash Elwyn, the president and CEO of Raymond James & Associates, has been named to lead the Pinellas Education Foundation’s board of directors, the foundation announced Tuesday. Elwyn, a St. Petersburg resident, becomes the board’s chairperson after serving on the board for almost seven  years, including as its vice chairperson since 2020. He succeeds Charles M. Harris, shareholder and litigator at Trenam Law, the foundation said in a news release. “What gets me out of bed in the morning is the opportunity we have to make a difference in people’s lives,” Elwyn said in the release. “The Pinellas Education Foundation is committed to accelerating students’ success and for some students, that scholarship or mentor makes the difference in the trajectory of their lives, changing outcomes for their families forever.” The foundation’s board has more than 30 members who work with foundation CEO Stacy Baier and the staff. • • • Sign up for the Gradebook newsletter!
