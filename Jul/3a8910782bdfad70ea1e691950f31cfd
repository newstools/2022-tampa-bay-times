TAMPA — Hillsborough County Commissioner Gwen Myers recalled the 1966 Motown hit from The Temptations on Thursday as she sought money for two park projects in her district — Ain’t Too Proud to Beg. “I’m not begging, but I’m pleading and asking… to see if we can find additional funds in the county’s budget to make these two projects happen,” Myers told the rest of the commission. Her pitch for an $850,000 water splash pad at Kings Forest Park and $2.35 million in renovations at Progress Village Park came as commissioners considered divvying up more than $18 million in discretionary spending in the proposed 2022-23 county budget. The so-called flag items from each commissioner totaled more than $ 21 million without Myers added request. She already had asked for $2.6 million for 19 items including $1.5 million to renovate Kings Forest Park. Commissioners, however, agreed with her call to find other available money to cover the projects and Commissioner Stacy White suggested park impact fees or federal block grants could be used. But the board wasn’t as accommodating to commission chairperson Kimberly Overman’s appeal for additional spending on affordable housing. “This is an opportunity for us to invest in our communities that may be very much in crisis next year,” said Overman, pointing out that federal rental assistance programs tied to the pandemic will be ending in 2023. The proposed budget from County Administrator Bonnie Wise already included a $10 million allocation for affordable housing. Overman initially sought $7 million more. She lowered her request to $3.8 million, but it still didn’t pass muster with the rest of the commissioners, each of whom could account for about $2.6 million worth of projects. The discussions were the first public debate on the nearly $8.56 billion budget proposal for the coming fiscal year, which amounts to a 14.4 percent spending increase financed by rising property values, new construction joining the tax rolls and proceeds from sales taxes. After tens of millions of dollars in allocations toward public safety and other needs, the commission was left with their own flag items Thursday before giving initial approval to status quo tax rates for the coming year. Final adoption of the budget and tax rates will come after two public hearings in September. The big ticket items on the flag list included $2.1 million for the South County Greenway Trail, $1.5 million to renovate the Historic 1914 School — now serving as a community center and museum — in Plant City, $1.5 million for the Tampa Museum of Art, $1 million for Cross Creek Park, $740,000 for the Wimauma community plan and $500,000 for the Museum of Science and Industry.
