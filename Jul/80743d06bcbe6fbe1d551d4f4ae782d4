TORONTO — The Rays got back one experienced hitter to help their anemic offense today, activating centerfielder Kevin Kiermaier after a 10-day stint on the injured list due to left hip inflammation. They also called up right-handed reliever David McKay to add a fresh arm to their bullpen. McKay recently rejoined the Rays, with whom he signed in spring training, after spending a few months with the Yankees. To make room on the roster, outfielder Luke Raley was optioned back to Triple-A Durham, as was lefty Ryan Yarbrough, who came up and worked 5 1/3 innings Thursday as Jeffrey Springs had to skip his scheduled start due to a family medical emergency. The Rays are coming off a 4-1 loss in Thursday’s opener of a five-game series (in four days) with the Blue Jays. Right-hander Corey Kluber will start for the Rays today in the 3:07 p.m. game, with a large Canada Day crowd expected at Rogers Centre. Right-hander Jose Berrios will start for the Blue Jays. Here is the Rays lineup, with manager Kevin Cash juggling the order a bit to try to create more scoring opportunities: And for the Jays: • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
