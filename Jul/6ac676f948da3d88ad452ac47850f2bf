BALTIMORE — Drew Rasmussen will take the mound for the Rays tonight on his 27th birthday. Plus he will get to face his former Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, who will be behind the plate for the Orioles. In what seems like some extreme coincidences, Rasmussen will be the third Rays pitcher to start on his birthday this season — and all against the Orioles. Corey Kluber did so on April 10 at home vs. Baltimore, and Shane Baz on June 17 at Camden Yards. This is the first time in the Rays’ 25-season history that they had three pitchers make birthday starts, and per research by the Rays, the first time for any team since the 2019 Padres. Rasmussen has never pitched on his birthday as a pro. He is seeking to join four former Rays who started and won on their birthday: Mark Hendrickson, June 23, 2005, at the Yankees; Jae Seo, May 24, 2007, vs. Mariners; and Jeremy Hellickson, April 8, 2012, vs. Yankees. Overall the Rays have had 11 pitchers make 13 birthday starts, going a combined 4-4 with a 4.33 ERA. With Francisco Mejia (shoulder impingement) joining Mike Zunino (season-ending thoracic outlet syndrome surgery) on the injured list, the Rays have two somewhat inexperienced catchers in recently acquired Christian Bethancourt, who makes a second straight start tonight, and rookie Rene Pinto, who was called up from Triple-A. Also of note, the Rays have reliever Ralph Garza Jr. in Baltimore as a member of the taxi squad.
