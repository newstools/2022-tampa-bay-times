BALTIMORE — Shane McClanahan takes the mound for the Rays tonight, his first action since throwing the opening inning in the All-Star Game a week ago, and his first start for the Rays since July 13. Though this is the Rays’ fifth series of the season against the Orioles, this is the first time McClanahan will face them since the April 8 season opener. “They’re a completely different team,” McClanahan said of the Baltimore team that has played its way into wild-card contention. The Rays have lost three straight, two to the Royals and the opener of the four-game set to the Orioles. The Rays are giving shortstop Taylor Walls a day off, with Yu Chang getting the start against Orioles right-hander Spenser Watkins. Here is the Rays lineup, with Luke Raley, who had two doubles on Monday, making a fourth straight start: Orioles lineup when available. • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
