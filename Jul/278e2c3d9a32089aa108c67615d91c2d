Tampa-based Caspers Company announced Monday it plans to sell all of its McDonald’s locations and franchises on Oct. 1, according to media release. Caspers Company has owned and operated McDonald’s businesses around Tampa since 1958, and was considered to be the largest franchise in Florida. Fritz Casper opened the state’s first McDonald’s on South Dale Mabry Highway after meeting Ray Kroc, founder of McDonald’s, at a department store in Chicago, the release said. Since then, three generations of the Casper family have run a network of fast food-chain franchises in the region. Blake Casper and Allison Casper Adams could not be reached for comment Monday afternoon. No other details about the sale were disclosed. The family owns 60 McDonald’s stores, 51 in Tampa Bay and nine in Jacksonville, said Dustin Portillo, spokesperson for Caspers Company. The local stores include the McDonald’s at Tampa General Hospital. “(Blake and Allison) just felt it was the right time to get out of the McDonald’s world and sell off their stores and start a new chapter,” Portillo said. “We are respecting our past and reimagining our future.” Casper and Adams notably founded the Oxford Exchange, a venue in Tampa which houses a restaurant, bookstore, gift store, coworking space and design studio in 2012. More recently, they opened the Library, the restaurant on the Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital campus in St. Petersburg in 2018. Under the hospitality company Oxford Commons, they also own and operate the Current Hotel, a Marriott Autograph hotel at Rocky Point, and the Stovall House. They plan to open Predalina, a Mediterranean seafood restaurant at Water Street in 2023, Portillo said. The family is also investors in Riverside Recovery, a drug and alcohol addiction center in Hillsborough County, he said. Times staff writer Sue Carlton contributed to this report.
