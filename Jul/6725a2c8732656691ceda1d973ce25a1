TAMPA — An overnight fire late Saturday severely damaged the inside of a home in Tampa’s exclusive Avila community, according to Hillsborough County Fire Rescue officials. A 911 caller reported the blaze at 10:38 p.m. at the home along Villarreal de Avila, a winding roadway that runs in a loop through the sprawling complex. The caller reported that the house was full of smoke. Firefighters arrived, entered the home and found the kitchen engulfed in flames. They ran a hose line from a street hydrant through the front door and extinguished the blaze, while opening doors and windows to ventilate the home. They did not find anyone inside. The area around the kitchen was the only part of the home damaged. No one was reported to be hurt. Firefighters determined the fire started after someone left a pot on a hot stove, according to a news release. Photos from inside showed open, charred ceilings, and floors and granite countertops littered with burned debris. An estimate of the damages was not available. Fire officials did not provide the exact address where the fire occurred. Avila is an upscale community north of Bearss Avenue and Lake Magdalene Boulevard that features million-dollar mansions, a country club and lakeside views. Walled-off, and guarded by 24-hour security, the community is home to some of the Tampa area’s wealthiest residents.
