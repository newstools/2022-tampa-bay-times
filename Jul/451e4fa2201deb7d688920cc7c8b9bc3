 Vice President Kamala Harris will meet with military leadership at Tampa’s MacDill Air Force Base on Thursday, after first stopping in Orlando to advocate for abortion rights. Harris will meet with service members and receive a briefing from the leadership of U.S. Central Command and Special Operations Command, which are both headquartered in Tampa. The briefings will focus on how the two units are executing the Biden administration’s priorities, including support for Ukraine against the Russian invasion, a spokesperson told the Tampa Bay Times. Harris’ visit coincides with President Joe Biden’s visit to the Middle East. The vice president’s briefing will include discussions about the United States’ partnerships in the region. Before Tampa, Harris is scheduled to visit Orlando for an event hosted by her Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, after which she will hold a roundtable with state lawmakers to advocate for abortion rights in Florida. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra will join Harris at that panel. A spokesperson for Harris said she will “encourage legislators to continue fighting to protect reproductive rights” in the state. Florida is in the midst of a legal battle over a new state law banning nearly all abortions after 15 weeks since a person’s last menstrual period.
