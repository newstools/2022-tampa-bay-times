ESPN’s Sean Kelley is the new “Voice of the Gators,” replacing Florida legend Mick Hubert. Kelley has more than two decades of professional experience, including three years as ESPN Radio’s lead college football play-by-play announcer. He also has been on NFL, NBA, MLB and college basketball broadcasts; he called the Rays-Red Sox game Monday at Fenway Park. “Florida is one of the elite of the elites with regard to intercollegiate athletics,” Kelley said in a statement. “That makes it not only a destination job for anyone in our business, it makes it a destination job for those who have reached certain heights in our business. “With the two new head coaches I’ll be working with, there’s an excitement level at Florida that is unparalleled in the country with Billy Napier and Todd Golden. And then the tradition of success at that university. It’s undeniable how attractive the Florida job is and how deeply humbled I am that I would even be considered, let alone chosen as the person to be a part of that and to follow a 33-year legend in Mick Hubert.” Hubert retired earlier this spring. Kelley will become only the fourth person to be the “Voice of the Gators,” after Otis Boggs (1940-82), David Steele (1982-89) and Hubert (1989-2022). “I am excited to have someone with Sean’s talents and experience as the new play-by-play voice of the Gators,” athletic director Scott Stricklin said in a statement. “This position attracted a large number of highly qualified applicants, but Sean rose above the field early on in this process.” Kelley, a St. Louis native, called Tulane football, basketball and baseball games from 2002-05. The Southern Illinois alumnus also has been a broadcaster for Missouri, the New Orleans Pelicans and the New Orleans Saints. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
