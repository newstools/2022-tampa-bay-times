KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Rays open post-All-Star break play tonight with a weekend series against the Royals. Drew Rasmussen will start the opener for the Rays, who won 11 of 16 games heading into the break but lost one of their most productive hitters Sunday when Harold Ramirez had his right thumb broken by a pitch. Free agent Roman Quinn, who played parts of six seasons with the Phillies, was signed to take his place as a right-handed-hitting outfielder. Right-hander Brad Keller will start for the Royals. Of some note, Ji-Man Choi is in the lineup tonight as the designated hitter after being given off the Sunday before the break.
