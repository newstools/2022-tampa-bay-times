Former Arkansas and SMU coach Chad Morris has joined USF’s staff as an offensive analyst, the Bulls announced Monday afternoon. Morris, 53, served as Clemson’s offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for four seasons (2011-2014), partially coinciding with Bulls coach Jeff Scott’s lengthy tenure as Tigers receivers coach. Clemson won at least 10 games each of those seasons, with three bowl triumphs. “Chad and I have a great relationship and had a lot of success working together for four seasons under Coach (Dabo) Swinney at Clemson,” Scott said in a statement released by the school. “We are very excited to welcome Chad to South Florida and I look forward to him working with (first-year) offensive coordinator Travis Trickett, our returning staff members and me as we employ a fast-paced and exciting offense.” Morris left Clemson for the SMU vacancy in 2015, amassing a 14-22 record over three seasons. The Mustangs improved their win total each year under Morris, culminating with a 7-5 mark in 2017. That led to the opportunity at Arkansas, where Morris won only four of 22 games before his dismissal late in the 2019 season. He spent the 2020 season as offensive coordinator for Gus Malzahn at Auburn, which finished the abbreviated regular season 6-4. Malzahn was fired at season’s end. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more. Follow our Tampa Bay Times sports team on Twitter and Facebook.
