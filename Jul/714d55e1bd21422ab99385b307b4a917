The Florida Gators will have three assistant coaches making $1 million, according to contracts released Friday through open-records requests. Co-defensive coordinators Patrick Toney and Sean Spencer will both make $1 million each season, as will offensive coordinator Rob Sale. Last year’s defensive coordinator, Todd Grantham, was the only seven-figure assistant on that staff; USA Today calculated his total pay at $1.8 million. Only two programs in the country had three assistants earn at least $1 million last year, according to USA Today’s database: Texas and Ohio State. Head coach Billy Napier’s 10 assistants will collectively earn just shy of $7.1 million — a little less than the salary pool specified in his contract ($7.5 million). Another $5 million is allocated for support staff. Terms of Napier’s deal were previously disclosed. He’ll make $7.1 million this year, not including $100,000 in moving expenses. He’s due to receive $100,000 annual raises until the contract expires (Jan. 31, 2029). If he’s fired without cause, the Gators owe him 85 percent of what’s left on his contract. Bonuses include: $125,000 for an appearance in the SEC title game, $250,000 for an SEC championship, $100,000 for a bowl appearance, $250,000 for a major bowl appearance, $500,000 for playing in a College Football Playoff semifinal and $1 million for a national title. The salaries for Napier’s other assistants: Running backs coach Jabbar Juluke: $450,000 Cornerbacks coach Corey Raymond: $725,000 Inside linebackers coach Jay Bateman: $425,000 Receivers coach Keary Colbert: $500,000 Tight ends coach William Peagler: $425,000 Outside linebackers coach Mike Peterson: $550,000 Offensive line coach Darnell Stapleton: $250,000 Director of football strength and conditioning Mark Hocke: $750,000 All assistant coaching contracts run through January 2024. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
