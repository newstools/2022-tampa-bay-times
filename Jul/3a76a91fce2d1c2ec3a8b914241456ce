COVID-19 cases in Florida hovered around an average of 11,000 cases per day during the 7-day period from July 15-21. It’s the eighth consecutive week with more than 10,000 cases per day. The state has recorded more than 600,000 new infections since cases started climbing in March. And sustained case rates have put added pressure on the state’s healthcare system. Florida hospitals had 4,178 confirmed COVID-19 patients on Friday. The BA.5 variant of Omicron accounted for nearly 77% of infections in the southeast, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The variant appears to be more infectious than prior strains of the COVID-19 virus and is able to evade prior immunity from vaccination or infection, according to the agency, which recommends that eligible residents should get a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Less than half of eligible Florida residents have gotten even their first booster. Federal health officials reported Thursday that all but two Florida counties are at “high” risk of COVID-19, including the entire Tampa Bay area and most of south Florida. That means that nearly 98% of Florida residents live in counties at “high” risk of COVID-19. The CDC suggests that all residents in “high” level counties wear a well-fitting mask in public indoor spaces. Symptomatic residents should get tested immediately.
