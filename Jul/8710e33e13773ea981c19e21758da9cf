CINCINNATI — The Rays are set, weather permitting, to open a three-game series against the Reds tonight in their first visit to Cincinnati since 2014. Ace Shane McClanahan will be on the mound, seeking his 10th win and hoping to further his case to start the All-Star Game, with his selection to the American League squad set to be made official on Sunday. McClanahan is 9-3 and leads the AL with a 1.74 ERA and 133 strikeouts. McClanahan said he was looking forward to the challenge of facing a new team, though he also was hoping to get to pitch to longtime Reds star Joey Votto. But Votto is not in the lineup, out with a back issue. Infielder Yu Chang, acquired off waivers from the Pirates on Tuesday, was added to the Rays’ roster and will wear No. 9. Vidal Brujan was sent down, primarily to give him an opportunity to play regularly at Triple-A, Rays manager Kevin Cash said. The Reds are starting right-hander Luis Castillo, who is expected to be a hot commodity at the trade deadline. Heavy rains had been in the forecast, but the skies have cleared somewhat and there should be a good window to get in the game, which starts at 6:40 p.m. Cash said he spoke Friday afternoon with Brandon Lowe, who was hit on helmet by a pitch Thursday in his first rehab game. Cash said Lowe’s headache had subsided and he could resume workouts as soon as Saturday, and didn’t know yet if this would impact his projected return. Here is the Rays’ lineup: And for the Reds, with former Florida Gator Jonathan India leading off and ex-Ray Tommy Pham in leftfield: • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
