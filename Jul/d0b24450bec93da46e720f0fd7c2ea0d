A new condo in Tampa’s Water Street district sold for just under $8 million, the highest condominium sale on record in the Tampa Bay area, according to Smith & Associates Real Estate. William Koenig and Melinda Witmer purchased the 5,063-square-foot condo in the Residences at the Tampa Edition — which also boasts a five-star hotel — on July 19, according to Hillsborough County property records. Koenig is the National Basketball Association’s president of global content and media distribution and Witmer is the founder and CEO of a real estate and home design startup called Foiye. The four-bedroom, five-bathroom condo is one of 37 in the building. Residents will have access to all the hotel’s amenities, including the spa as well as the rooftop pool and terrace. Stacey Borsik Niebles from Smith & Associates facilitated the sale. The Tampa Edition hotel and residences is slated to open later this year. The property, managed by Marriott, will have 172 hotel rooms over 26 floors. The previous record for most expensive condo in the area was set just a few weeks ago, when a unit in downtown St. Petersburg’s Vinoy Place sold for $7.3 million.
