An Orlando man was sent to the hospital Monday after a shark in Daytona Beach bit him, officials said. The 33-year-old man was in a popular resort area, near 1025 S. Atlantic Ave., when the incident happened, Deputy Chief Tamra Malphurs with Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue said in a statement. He was in waist-deep water when he was bitten on the right foot, presumably by a shark, she said. He was sent to the hospital for treatment. His injuries are not considered life-threatening. This is the sixth shark bite of the year in the county. In 2021, 63% of the state’s total shark bites happened in Volusia County, according to the International Shark Attack File. In the last 10 years, no one has died from a shark bite in Volusia County. The organization recommends avoiding swimming alone and between dusk and dawn. Also, beachgoers should avoid entering the water with open wounds or flashy jewelry, which can be mistaken for fish scales. The odds of getting bitten by a shark are a little less than one in 4 million, according to the website. A person is 10 times more likely to get killed by fireworks.
