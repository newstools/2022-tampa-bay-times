BALTIMORE — Veteran Corey Kluber will be on the mound for the Rays tonight — weather permitting — as they take on the Orioles. The Rays (52-43) are coming off a disappointing weekend in Kansas City, where they lost the last two games, and late after coming back to tie. Kluber, the veteran free agent signed to a one-year deal, has pitched relatively well to this point of the season with a 6-5, 3.73 record and, as importantly, stayed healthy after his last three seasons were interrupted by injury. Right-hander Austin Voth will be on the mound for the Orioles, who, at 47-48, are five games behind the Rays in the wild-card race. Rain, as often seems to be the case when the Rays visit, is in the forecast for tonight, and the tarp was put on the field around 3:20 p.m. Here is the Rays lineup, with Luke Raley getting another start: And for the Orioles: • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
