A little rule of thumb regarding the dog days of the NFL offseason: Any news about your favorite team at this stage of the summer generally is bad (arrest, freak accident, etc.) or bogus. Which leads us to the recent claims by sports radio host (and onetime Buccaneer) Dan Sileo that the Bucs are trying to work a trade to bring in 49ers quarterback and former Tom Brady teammate Jimmy Garoppolo. Nonsense, Garoppolo’s agent says. NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero said Monday morning that Don Yee — who also represents Brady — dismissed Sileo’s reports while also providing an update on Garoppolo’s recovery from shoulder surgery in March. “He’s progressing well and on schedule,” Yee told Pelissero. “We’re optimistic about the upcoming season. Over the weekend, a report came out that asserted that I had spoken to a media member about his future, but the report was false.” Because the 49ers are expected to move forward with second-year quarterback Trey Lance, whom they selected with the No. 3 overall pick in 2021, trade rumors regarding Garoppolo have abounded for months. The Bucs once were considered a plausible destination for the 30-year-old once Tom Brady retired, but that speculation was rendered moot when Brady un-retired. Moreover, Bucs coaches — particularly former head coach Bruce Arians — have remained high on current Tampa Bay backup Blaine Gabbert, widely believed to have a stronger arm than even a healthy Garoppolo. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
