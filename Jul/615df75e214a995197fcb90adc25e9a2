TAMPA ― Getting a ticket to watch the Bucs and Tom Brady has never been easy. Games against the Packers, Chiefs and Rams at Raymond James Stadium already are among the most popular for this season. The Bucs are adding 3,600 seats to increase the homefield capacity to roughly 70,000 for 2022. But demand is even heavier overseas. Tickets to the Bucs-Seahawks game Nov. 13 at Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany went on sale to the general public on Ticketmaster Tuesday. According to Pro Football Talk, some fans posted on social media that they received messages that as many as 2 million people were waiting ahead of them in a virtual queue. It’s the NFL’s first-ever regular-season game in Germany and has been so well-received that the price of those tickets — ranging in face value from $65-$165 — all have sold out. Stubhub currently lists the resale value of those tickets from $585 to $33,760. The game is the fourth overseas for the Bucs. Brady is clearly a draw, but there obviously are a lot of NFL fans in Europe. If you plan on going and don’t yet have a ticket to the game, expect to pay skyrocketing prices. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
