TAMPA — Just a few hours before Saturday’s rookie reporting date, the Bucs agreed to terms on a four-year deal with defensive lineman Logan Hall. The team’s second-round pick and the first in the second round overall (No. 33), Hall will receive a four-year deal slotted to be worth $9.316 million by the rookie salary pool. The only question was how much of that would be guaranteed. Hall was the highest-drafted player without a contract in the NFL until he agreed to terms late Friday. At 6-foot-6, 275 pounds, Hall should have an immediate impact on the Bucs’ defensive line. He impressed coaches with his tenacity in the offseason and should be in a rotation as an interior defensive lineman with Akiem Hicks, William Gholston and Rakeem Nunez-Roches. The agreement with Hall left only one member of the Bucs’ 2022 draft class unsigned as rookies report today. Tight end Cade Otton, the Bucs’ fourth-round pick from Washington, has not yet reached an agreement, though one was expected later Saturday. The team also announced it has placed cornerback Don Gardner and offensive lineman Sadarius Hutcherson on the active/physically unable to perform list. Otton missed the offseason recovering from ankle surgery in November but has been cleared to begin training camp. Hall, 22, had 47 tackles, including 13 for loss, with 6-1/2 sacks  in 12 games with the Cougars last season. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
