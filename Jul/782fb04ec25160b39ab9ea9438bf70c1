AutoWeb, a publicly traded car-shopping and car-dealing platform headquartered in Tampa, is being sold. The company announced Monday that its board has reached a deal to be acquired by San Francisco-area tech conglomerate One Planet Group, a firm founded by AutoWeb founder Payam Zamani. Under the terms of the deal, One Planet Group will pay 39 cents cash per AutoWeb share. Based on the number of shares outstanding at the company, that translates to just under $5.5 million. The deal is expected to close by Sept. 16. “Not many founders get the opportunity to return to a company that they helped create,” Zamani said in a statement. “AutoWeb has been a pioneer in the online automotive industry and in many ways directly influenced its evolution. It is now time for the company to experience an evolution to prepare for the challenges and the opportunities in the automotive industry of tomorrow.” Zamani will take on the roles of president and CEO at AutoWeb, replacing Jared Rowe. AutoWeb, which offers marketing services for dealers and sellers, traces its roots to the mid-’90s, when it was founded under the name Autobytel — a brand it still owns, along with Car.com and UsedCars.com. In 2015, the company acquired longtime rival AutoWeb — the company founded by Zamani — and later adopted that name as its main brand. The company relocated its corporate headquarters from Irvine, California, to Tampa in 2019. The company, which went public in 1999, has had a few ups and downs over the years; shortly after the pandemic began, it received a Paycheck Protection Program loan worth nearly $1.4 million. It reported revenues of $51.1 million last year, down 15% from the year before. In May, AutoWeb’s stock fell precipitously after a record sell-off spurred by an earnings report that showed the company burning through cash, racking up debt and “raising substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern,” it said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The company’s valuation has dropped from nearly $50 million in January to the $5.5 million offer made public Monday. One Planet Group’s 39 cents per share offer is down slightly from its Friday close of just under 43 cents per share. AutoWeb stock dropped to 39 cents when the NASDAQ opened Monday.
