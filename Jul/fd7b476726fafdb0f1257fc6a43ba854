COVID-19 cases in Florida averaged 10,478 per day during the 7-day period from July 22-28. It’s the ninth consecutive week that average daily cases exceeded 10,000. Florida hospitals had more than 4,000 confirmed COVID-19 patients as of Friday. Federal health officials reported Thursday that all but three Florida counties are at “high” risk of COVID-19, accounting for more than 98% of Florida residents. That includes the entire Tampa Bay area, which has been at “high” risk for more than two months. The CDC suggests that all residents in “high” level counties wear well-fitting masks in public indoor spaces. Symptomatic residents should get tested immediately. The sustained surge is likely due to the BA.5 omicron variant, which now accounts for four out of five infections in the southeast, according to an analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In response, federal health officials are trying to speed up the availability of variant-specific booster doses, which can better combat the highly mutated variant, NPR reported. Federal health officials announced Friday that 66 million doses of the new booster will be available as soon as September.
