ST. PETERSBURG — In between being named to the American League All-Star team on Sunday and heading to the game at Dodger Stadium next week, Shane McClanahan has some business to attend to for the Rays. He will take care of that tonight, facing the Red Sox at Tropicana Field. McClanahan has been on quite a roll, going into tonight’s game with a 9-3 record and ranking among the major-league leaders in ERA (1.73, second), opponents OPS (.514, second) and strikeouts (141, second), among other categories. He also is on an AL-record streak of 11 straight starts of working six or more innings, striking out seven or more and allowing two or fewer runs. Only Randy Johnson (14 in 1999 for Arizona) and Mike Scott (12 in 1986 for Houston) have had longer such runs. McClanahan will be facing Boston’s Josh Winckowski, and this isn’t the first time they squared off as both played high school ball in the Fort Myers area. McClanahan was pitching for Cape Coral High and Winckowski for Cypress Lake when they met on April 4, 2014. Also Wednesday: • Rays lefty Josh Fleming will be sidelined three to six weeks after an MRI showed a Grade 1 strain of his right oblique. Ryan Yarbrough is expected to be called up from Triple-A Durham to take Fleming’s place and work bulk innings on Saturday. • Rays right-hander Corey Kluber reached the milestone of 10 years in the majors today; manager Kevin Cash gathered the team before the game to acknowledge the accomplishment. • The Red Sox got good news; X-rays were negative on the right hand of infielder Trevor Story and the left wrist of pitcher Matt Strahm.
