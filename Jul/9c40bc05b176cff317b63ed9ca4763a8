TAMPA — Tight end Cade Otton signed a four-year contract with the Bucs Sunday, becoming the final draft pick to agree to terms. Otton, a fourth-round pick from Washington, missed all of the offseason recovering from ankle surgery he underwent in November. In four seasons at Washington, Otton caught 91 passes for 1,026 yards and nine touchdowns. The 6-foot-5, 247-pounder figures to play a prominent role following the retirement of Rob Gronkowski. Otton, the grandson of the winningest high school football coach in Washington, is a classic Y or in-line tight end who can run-block and catch. The Bucs also drafted Minnesota tight end Ko Kieft in the sixth round, although he has been used primarily as a blocker. Otton won’t be pressed into service with the signing last week of former Giants and Vikings tight end Kyle Rudolph, 32, who is equally effective as a blocker or pass-catcher. Cameron Brate, 31, figures to be heavily involved in the passing game and in the red zone. Bucs rookies reported to training camp Saturday, with the full squad expected Tuesday. The first workout is Wednesday. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
