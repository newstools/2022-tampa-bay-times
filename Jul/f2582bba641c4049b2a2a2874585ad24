TAMPA — Two people were killed Monday in a crash on an Interstate 275 exit ramp that was snarling traffic on the Howard Frankland Bridge, troopers said. The crash happened about 7:45 a.m. on the Kennedy Boulevard exit ramp from northbound I-275 and involved multiple vehicles, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. Two people died at the scene. Traffic cameras in the area showed traffic on the ramp using the shoulder to get by the crash scene but troopers may need to close all lanes intermittently as they investigate and clear the scene, a Highway Patrol spokesperson said.
