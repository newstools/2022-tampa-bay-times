A heat advisory was issued for Hillsborough and Manatee counties on Thursday, prompting Hillsborough County officials to issue a news release encouraging residents to stay indoors. The notice also encourages residents to stay hydrated and to check in on neighbors or loved ones who might be vulnerable to the heat. The heat index on Thursday afternoon is expected to reach up to 110 degrees. The heat advisory is in effect from noon until 6 p.m. “Hillsborough residents without access to adequate air conditioning can find refuge in a variety of public places like libraries or shopping malls,” Hillsborough County’s news release states. Meteorologists at Spectrum Bay News 9 said low rain chances are helping to fuel the high temperatures. Rain chances, which often are 50% or better during summer days in the Tampa Bay area, were only 20% for today and Friday. They increase a bit to 30% on Saturday but will return to 20% Sunday. Rain chances don’t increase to 40% until toward the middle of next week. The county said residents also can refill water bottles in parks, libraries, or other facilities. People who work or spend time outside during the hottest part of the day are encouraged to take precautions including rescheduling strenuous activities to the evening. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks in shaded or air-conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat stroke is an emergency and residents can call 911 to access immediate care, the county said.
