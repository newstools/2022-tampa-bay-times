Multi-platinum singer-songwriter Shawn Mendes has canceled the rest of the dates on his Wonder: The World Tour dates in North America and Europe. He was set to play Tampa’s Amalie Arena on Oct. 11. A Facebook post from Amalie Arena stated that ticketholders should check with their point of purchase for refunds. Mendes announced that he was canceling the tour, citing that he wasn’t prepared for the “toll that being back on the road” would take on him. ”After speaking more with my team and working with an incredible group of health professionals, it has become more clear that I need to take the time I’ve never taken personally, to ground myself and come back stronger,” the post continued. Mendes concluded by saying, “... I promise I will be back as soon as I’ve taken the right time to heal. I love you all and thank you all so much for supporting me and sticking by me on this journey.”
