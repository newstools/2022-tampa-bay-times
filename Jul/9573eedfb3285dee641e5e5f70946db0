Largo police arrested a man on the Fourth of July who they say slashed at least 19 car tires in a city neighborhood. In an arrest affidavit, police said they were summoned to a neighborhood in the area of 115th and 116th streets about 10 p.m. on Monday. A witness had seen a man “bent down by a car tire with the tire hissing,” the report states. A neighbor confronted the man by another car. Police responded and found that at least 19 car tires had been slashed and what appeared to be initials had been scratched into one car’s hood, the report states. Police arrested the suspect, a 32-year-old homeless man who they said was intoxicated, on a charge of felony criminal mischief. Police said the total damage amounted to at least $2,500 and that officers continued to canvass the neighborhood that night in search of more potential victims.
