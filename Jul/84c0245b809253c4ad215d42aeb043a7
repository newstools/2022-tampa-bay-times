Scattered showers and thunderstorms expected throughout the afternoon and early evening across Tampa Bay should let up by the time most Fourth of July fireworks shows kick off. Monday morning’s dry weather and sunny skies paved the way for a typical summer afternoon — hot and humid, with highs around 91 degrees. The chance of rain will increase to 60% around 2 p.m., with showers and thunderstorms likely, according to the National Weather Service. Most of the severe weather will have dissipated by the time the holiday’s evening firework shows begin, around 9 p.m., with the chance of storms dropping to 40%. Some coastal areas could experience a slightly higher chance of storms around that time, as the system moves off the coast, forecasters said. Daytime temperatures are expected to hover in the low 90s, with heat index values reaching as high as 102. Following the afternoon’s showers, temperatures are expected to dip down to the low 80s by tonight.
