On Monday, NASA unveiled one of the first images taken by the agency’s powerful James Webb Space Telescope, the mightiest instrument ever sent into outer space. Scientists have hailed the mission as one that could transform astrophysics and our understanding of the universe. Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. will bring a new cache of images, which will be livestreamed on NASA’s YouTube channel. Monday night, NASA released its first image showing galaxy cluster SMACS 0723. The telescope is designed to peer back so far that scientists can get a glimpse of the dawn of the universe about 13.7 billion years ago and zoom in on closer cosmic objects, even our own solar system, with sharper focus. Museums and libraries around the Tampa Bay area have planned special events to join NASA in celebrating the release. Tampa’s Museum of Science and Industry, the Great Explorations Children’s Museum in St. Petersburg and local libraries have special displays and space activities planned at 10:30 a.m. to show the telescope’s first full-color images and spectroscopic data, which is detailed information astronomers can read in light as three-dimensional “data cubes.” “Released one by one, these first images from the world’s largest and most powerful space telescope will demonstrate Webb at its full power as it begins its mission to unfold the infrared universe,” NASA said in a news release. Webb is a $10-billion space telescope — the largest ever built. It holds mirrors spanning more than 21 feet across made out of gold-plated beryllium that are designed to gather infrared light. The space agency expects that it will be able to peer into the deepest recesses of the universe to show the first stars and galaxies that formed just after the Big Bang. It took more than six months of travel and calibration to prepare the telescope for its moment in the spotlight.
