Part of the Courtney Campbell Causeway was shut down after a vehicle caught fire Monday afternoon, according to the Clearwater Police Department. The westbound lanes of the causeway were closed off on the Pinellas side around 4 p.m., Clearwater police said. Motorists were advised to seek alternate routes for the afternoon commute. Pictures posted to the Police Department’s social media accounts showed a charred tractor on the side of the road. The driver noticed there was a problem with the 20-foot-long trailer, pulled over and detached it from the vehicle towing it. Police described the trailer as a “total loss” after the fire, the agency said in an updated news release around 5 p.m. The fire started when a tire blew out on the trailer, causing sparks that ignited it, according to a 7 p.m. news release. The trailer was used as a workstation for a seamless gutter installer, according to the release. The cause of the fire has not been determined. No injuries have been reported, police said. By 7 p.m. all lanes had reopened to traffic, according to the updated news release. This is a developing story. Stay with tampabay.com for updates.
