The Florida Highway Patrol is investigating a fatal motorcycle crash on southbound U.S. 19 near Alderman Road that has caused three of four traffic lanes to be closed. The crash occurred just after 1:30 p.m. north of Alderman. Troopers have the three outside lanes closed, though the inside lane is open. “Motorists should expect southbound delays or seek alternate routes,” the Highway Patrol said in a news release. Troopers said the crash occurred when a 68-year-old Tampa man turned a 2013 Ford Fusion left in front of a motorcyclist at Colonial Boulevard. The motorcyclist, a 26-year-old Palm Harbor man, hit the side of the Fusion. The motorcyclist, who was wearing a helmet, died on scene, troopers said. No other information was immediately released.
