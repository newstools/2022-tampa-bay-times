BALTIMORE — Ryan Yarbrough will be on the mound this afternoon as the Rays try to split the four-game series with the Orioles and put a good finish on what has been a disappointing road trip to open post-All-Star break play. Yarbrough has at times been more effective pitching behind an opener, with the bullpen used heavily the times the Rays opted to have him start. Yarbrough is looking for his first win since since September, a span of 11 appearances, with an 0-6, 5.63 line. Two of the Rays’ most productive hitters, Randy Arozarena and Yandy Diaz, are not in the lineup against right-hander Jordan Lyles. Manager Kevin Cash said both are fine and just getting a day off, with the opportunity to pinch-hit later if needed. The Rays are 2-4 on this trip to Kansas City (1-2) and Baltimore (1-2), and head home to host the contending Guardians and Blue Jays. Earlier in the day, Rays third-base coach Rodney Linares was formally introduced as the manager of the Dominican Republic team for the upcoming World Baseball Classic.
