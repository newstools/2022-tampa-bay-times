Northbound traffic on Interstate 75 in Pasco County was blocked earlier this morning after a camper overturned. Florida Highway Patrol troopers said a 50-year-old Largo man was pulling a camper behind a Ford Expedition when it overturned at about 5:15 a.m. “Traveling too fast for conditions, the trailer began to fishtail resulting in a loss of control,” the highway patrol said in a news release. The driver and his five passengers were not injured in the crash, which occurred near Blanton Road. Northbound traffic was reduced to just a single lane using the shoulder, resulting in a backup. The overturned camper was moved to the side of the road and lanes began to open up about 7:30 a.m.
