A 74-year-old Dade City man was run over and killed by his own pickup truck Thursday while it was being towed, the Florida Highway Patrol said. According to the agency, it occurred around 6:30 p.m. in the driveway of a home located off St. Joe Road, near the intersection of Starbright Drive in Dade City. Troopers said the man’s truck was parked directly behind another pickup, driven by another 74-year-old man who planned to tow it from the driveway. That driver was waiting in his truck while the man connected the two vehicles together with a tow chain. The man managed to successfully hitch his pickup to the back of the other truck but was still standing between the vehicles when the other driver began to drive forward. The tow chain tightened and the man’s pickup truck knocked him to the ground, rolling over his body as it was pulled forward. The man died at the scene, troopers said. The driver of the other vehicle was not injured.
