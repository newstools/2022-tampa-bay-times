BOSTON — The Rays’ lineup has a different look again tonight, with Josh Lowe moved to the leadoff spot. The move seems based on trying to get a different look for Lowe, the rookie outfielder who is hitting just .170, 0-for-his-last-9 and 2-for-24. In 13 games since being called back up, he is hitting .146 (7-for-48). The Rays will face Red Sox right-hander Brayan Bello, a highly regarded prospect who has been called up to make his major-league debut. Rays manager Kevin Cash said of Bello: “I’ve read a little bit about him. Sounds like he’s discovered a fastball ... it went from 92 (mph) to now he’s throwing 99, so good for him. Not good for us. I hope he decides to throw 92.” Bello is the third pitcher this season to make his first big-league appearance against the Rays, joining Seattle’s George Kirby and Oakland’s Adam Oller. The Rays are 6-1 in their last seven games against starters making their MLB debut. The Rays are starting veteran Corey Kluber, who is coming off a rough outing at Toronto, where he lasted only three innings and took his third straight loss, his longest streak since 2016.
