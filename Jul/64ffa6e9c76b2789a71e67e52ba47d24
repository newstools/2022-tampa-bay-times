HOLIDAY — Two people were rushed to a Tampa hospital with severe burns Friday morning after they were pulled from a mobile home fire by Pasco County firefighters. Firefighters arrived at the single-wide mobile home on Buena Vista Lane in Holiday and reported “heavy fire involvement,” Pasco Fire Rescue spokesperson Corey Dierdorff said. Both of the adults inside were listed as “trauma alerts.” One was air-lifted from the scene by a medical helicopter to Tampa General Hospital and the other was taken there by ambulance. By 10:30 a.m., both remained in critical condition and were being treated in the hospital’s burn unit, he said. Firefighters managed to extinguish the blaze, but it grew large enough to create “hot spots” in the surrounding area, Dierdorff said. By Friday afternoon, Buena Vista Lane and other local road closures remained in effect as officials begin their investigation into the cause of the fire.
