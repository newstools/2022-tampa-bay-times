Our partners at Spectrum Bay News 9 tweeted out video of a waterspout that was captured on video Saturday afternoon. Heavy rain and thunderstorms marched through the area on Saturday, which is routine for this time of year in the afternoons and evenings. There were reports of standing water, lightning and windy conditions. Expect more of the same on Sunday, as Spectrum Bay News 9 has rain chances at 60 percent. Rain chances dip a little bit at the start of the work week. The chance of rain during the week will be closer to 30-40 percent each day, forecasters say.
