Forecasters with the National Hurricane Center are watching a disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico that has only a remote chance of strengthening into a tropical system but will still drench much of north Florida over the rest of the week. The rough patch of weather isn’t currently threatening the Tampa Bay area but rain will be heavy enough in north Florida that flash flooding could occur, forecasters said in an advisory issued at 2 p.m. Tuesday. Forecasters said the chance of the weather developing into a tropical system over the next five days is just 20 percent. The chances of heavy rain also extend west to Louisiana, forecasters said. • • • 2022 Tampa Bay Times Hurricane Guide IT'S STORM SEASON: Get ready and stay informed at tampabay.com/hurricane.
