BALTIMORE — The Rays announced a family-friendly initiative, offering free meals for kids 14 and under at home games through the end of August. The program, which launches with Friday’s game against Cleveland, provides each kid with a small hot dog, small fountain drink, chips and Hi-Chew candy, which is sponsoring the program. “Our goal is to provide a family-friendly ballpark experience and ensure that everyone can enjoy a Rays game at Tropicana Field,” Rays chief business officer Bill Walsh said in a statement. “We hope our Kids Eat Free program allows families to come together and experience the magic of Rays Baseball, while alleviating some of the stress that is often associated with attending a large event.” Per the Rays, this is how the program works: “The free meal is available exclusively via mobile ordering on the MLB Ballpark app at three concession locations throughout the ballpark: Whoa Doggy’s in the First Base Food Hall and Third Base Food Hall and Southern Fried in Center Field Street. Parents or guardians may claim meals using the promo code KIDSEATFREE for up to four kids per game, and all kids must be present when the meals are redeemed. Limit of one meal per child. Fountain drinks are redeemable at Coca-Cola refresh stations throughout the ballpark.” • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
