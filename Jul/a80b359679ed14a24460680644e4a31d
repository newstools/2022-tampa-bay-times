ST. PETERSBURG — The Rays used the No. 29 pick in the draft Sunday night on power-hitting first baseman Xavier Isaac from East Forsyth (N.C.) High School. Isaac, listed at 6-foot-4 and 240 pounds, is from Kernersville, N.C., and committed to the University of Florida. He hit .578 with 12 home runs, six doubles, two triples and 26 RBIs as a senior. The pick was considered somewhat of a surprise to the MLB Network analysts. East Forsyth High coach Drew Dull told the Winston-Salem Journal: “He is the best power guy I’ve ever coached. It’s the easiest power I’ve ever seen. ... There’s very few guys where I get behind an L-screen and throw batting practice where I’m scared behind the L-screen.” The pick has an assigned slot value of $2,547,600; the Rays have a total bonus pool of $7,795,100 for the first 10 rounds, which is 20th most of the 30 teams. The No. 29 pick was the Rays’ first of what was to be a busy opening night of the three-day, 20-round draft. They later were to make three selections in the span of seven — No. 65, which is their second-round pick; and Nos. 70 and 71, their competitive balance Round B pick and the one they got from the Tigers, along with Isaac Paredes, in the late-spring trade of Austin Meadows. Having the three picks so closely bunched was expected to create the opportunity for the Rays to be creative, perhaps in moving money around to pay more to one player who was expected to be go higher. The picks have similar slot amounts: No. 65, $1,077,100; No. 70, $952,800; No. 71, $929,100. Teams have until Aug. 1 to get the players signed. The Rays’ first-round picks over the last seven years include some names on the current big-league roster: outfielder Josh Lowe was the No. 13 pick in 2016; starter Drew Rasmussen was the No. 31 pick in 2017 (though didn’t sign and was later acquired in trade); All-Star starter Shane McClanahan was the No. 31 pick in 2018. Injured pitcher/hitter Brendan McKay was the No. 4 overall pick in 2017. The Rays’ top picks last year were high school infielders: Carson Williams at No. 28 and Cooper Kinney at No. 34.
