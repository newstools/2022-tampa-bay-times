A British sales and marketing company with clients including Oracle, Adobe and Xerox has picked Tampa to house its new U.S. headquarters. Clarify, which employs most of its global workforce of 170 across the Atlantic, will operate out of the WeWork offices at 501 E Kennedy Blvd. It plans to add 25 new sales, marketing, management and account services jobs in Tampa during its first year here, paying hires an average of $75,000 per year. “Our success globally has allowed us to break into the U.S. market where we see significant opportunity to expand our client base, so it was critical for us to establish an office in the U.S.,” Amanda Abernethy, chief strategy officer of Clarify, said in a statement. “Tampa is quickly establishing itself as a top technology hub with the skilled talent and projected growth we need to continue our success.” Clarify specializes in business-to-business marketing in the tech sector, with a client list that has included PayPal, Okta, Accenture and SAP. The region’s emerging tech landscape was a factor in the company’s decision to go with Tampa over other U.S. cities including Austin, where it also has an office. “The Tampa area is attracting some of the best talent in the country, along with a growing start-up scene and an impressive list of companies in high-growth industries,” Craig Richard, president and CEO of the Tampa Bay Economic Development Council, said in a statement. “We’re excited to welcome another growing international company that has chosen to launch its U.S. operations from Tampa.”
