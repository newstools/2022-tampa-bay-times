ATLANTA — As conference realignment continues to dominate college football’s offseason, the SEC has “no sense of urgency” to react, commissioner Greg Sankey said Monday. Sankey addressed the incoming additions of Texas and Oklahoma, pointing out that they’re in contiguous states to the conference’s geographic footprint and that they’re “like-minded” universities that fit with the rest of the league. “We know who we are,” Sankey said. He said later that the SEC will “watch what happens around us and be thoughtful but be nimble.” Sankey, kicking off SEC media days at the College Football Hall of Fame, suggested his league will not react hastily to the Big Ten’s recent decision to add USC and UCLA in 2024. Asked about the possibility of the Longhorns and Sooners joining the SEC sooner than 2025, Sankey said, “That’s not up to me.” That decision will be decided by those schools and the Big 12 and whether they negotiate an earlier exit. Sankey also said the league continues to debate a future football scheduling model — either eight or nine conference games. That discussion has been ongoing for months. Tie-breaking procedures, bowl eligibility and College Football Playoff considerations are among the holdups in those conversations. He also stressed the need for a national standard with name, image and likeness instead of the patchwork of state laws that govern the year-old model. LSU, Mississippi and Missouri are set to meet with reporters later today. The Gators will be here Wednesday.
