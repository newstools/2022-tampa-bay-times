President Joe Biden is scheduled to visit Tampa and Orlando on Monday, according to the White House. The Democratic National Committee confirmed the Tampa visit, saying Biden will be delivering remarks at a rally about the choice voters have in the midterm elections. Officials did not say whether Biden will be joined by Florida political candidates at the rally and did not disclose the specific venue. This will be Biden’s first visit as president to the Tampa Bay region. His visit comes less than two weeks after Vice President Kamala Harris’ swing through the area, when she received a briefing at Tampa’s MacDill Air Force Base and held a roundtable with Florida lawmakers on reproductive rights in Orlando. It will also cap a whirlwind period for political events in Tampa. Last weekend, the Florida Democratic Party and the conservative Moms for Liberty group hosted two dueling conferences in adjoining hotels in downtown Tampa. On Friday, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who is running for reelection, is scheduled to hold a roundtable on the supply chain at Port Tampa Bay and Gov. Ron DeSantis is slated to give a speech in Tampa for the Student Action Summit of Turning Point USA, a right-wing group for students. Former President Donald Trump is also scheduled to deliver a speech at the same event on Saturday.
