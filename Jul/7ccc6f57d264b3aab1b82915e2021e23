ST. PETERSBURG — Slugging first baseman Xavier Isaac signed with the Rays on Friday and said he is determined to show that he was worthy of being their first pick, and No. 29 overall. Issac’s selection that high in the draft was considered a surprise by some industry experts, and he said that will fuel his work as a pro, which starts Saturday morning in Port Charlotte. “Oh, it motivated me a lot,” Isaac said at Tropicana Field before Friday’s game against Cleveland. “The Rays had their trust in me — like they said, they don’t follow the board — so they trusted me, they got me, and I’m going to grind and I’m going to show everybody why I’m a first-rounder.” Isaac, 6 feet 5 and 240 pounds, signed for the slot bonus of $2,548,900. The product of East Forsyth (N.C.) High is also determined to prove he is more than just a power hitter and can play first base as well. “I‘m going to be a good first baseman defensively,” he said. “I hear that people don’t think I’m good defensively, but I am. I don’t make any errors. So it’s going to be fun.” And he said he plans to do all the work he can. “I have the best work ethic ever,” he said. “I’m going to come for your spot and I’ll tell you straight up. But I mean, I can’t wait.” This story will be updated. • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
