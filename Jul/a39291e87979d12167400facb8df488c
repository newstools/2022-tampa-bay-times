Some last-minute cancellations for this weekend’s Tampa Bay Comic Convention are leaving Marvel and “Dr. Who” fans in the lurch. Actor Paul Bettany, who plays Vision in the Marvel universe, and Christopher Eccleston, who played the ninth incarnation of the time-traveling doctor, have canceled their appearances. Bettany posted a video as “a quick message to Tampa area fans” on the convention’s Facebook page. “I’m not going to make it as I had intended. So I’m sorry if anybody bought tickets because they thought I was coming. Seems unlikely, but if you did, I owe you a drink,” Bettany said in the video. “Thank you and I’m sorry again.” Eccleston also had to cancel his appearance at the convention due to a new scheduling conflict, he announced on Facebook and Instagram over the weekend. “I’d just like to say I’m very sorry that I won’t be able to attend this coming weekend because of work and I will miss seeing you all very much. I hope very much to be able to make it next year,” Eccleston said in an Instagram video post. Tampa Bay Comic Convention organizers said both celebrities had to cancel “due to unforeseen circumstances,” but they left the door open. “We hope to have them again in the near future,” organizers said in a social media post. Those who purchased a photo op or other product with the celebrities who canceled can swap to another product, organizers said, or can get a refund. Tampa Bay Comic Convention posted instructions on how to proceed with either option on its Facebook page. Celebrities who are still scheduled to appear include William Shatner (“Star Trek”), Dean Cain (”Superman”), James “Murr” Murray (“Impractical Jokers”), R.J. Mitte (“Breaking Bad”) and Ross Marquand (“Walking Dead”). The convention runs Friday through Sunday at the Tampa Convention Center, 333 S Franklin St. 813-274-8511. $30-$125. tampabaycomicconvention.com.
