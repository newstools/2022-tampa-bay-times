EAST LAKE — Three bicyclists were hospitalized with serious injuries Thursday after a motorist turned her car into their path on East Lake Road, troopers said. The cyclists, all from Palm Harbor, included a 64-year-old man on a single-rider bicycle and a 65-year-old man and a 61-year-old woman on a tandem bicycle, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The cyclists were riding north on East Lake Road in a designated bicycle lane approaching the intersection of Trinity Boulevard around 8:30 a.m. At the same time, a 16-year-old New Port Richey girl driving south on East Lake Road in a sedan stopped in the left-hand turn lane, then turned left into the cyclists’ path, troopers said. Both bicycles collided with the right side of the girl’s car, causing serious injuries to all three cyclists. They were taken to local hospitals for treatment. The teen driver was not injured. The driver of the sedan was cited for violating the cyclists’ right of way, a Highway Patrol spokesperson said. The Highway Patrol typically does not release the names of people involved in crashes.
