California burger chain Fatburger is coming back to Tampa Bay, its parent company Fat Brands announced. Four locations of Fatburger and sister chain Buffalo’s Express are coming to the Tampa area by 2025, company spokesperson Erin Mandzik said. The first Fatburger is set to open next year in Riverview off of Interstate 75. Fatburger first came in 2003 to International Plaza and Clearwater Mall but have since closed, according to Tampa Bay Times archives. Mandzik said that Clearwater, Sarasota and St. Petersburg are currently not being considered for the expansion. Fatburger’s menu offers hamburgers with up to three ground beef patties or Impossible’s plant-based “meat,” as well as onion rings, milkshakes and chicken sandwiches. The chain launched more than 70 years ago and is based in Beverly Hills, Calif. The first location will be at the Tampa Shoppes at Alafia at 9950 Upper Alafia Court. Buffalo’s Express offers wings with nearly 20 different sauces including a scorching hot sauce called Death Valley. It also offers rice bowls, salads, shrimp, tacos, wraps, sandwiches and fried cheesecake. Whole Factor Inc. partnered with Fat Brands for the four-location franchise development and is also in the works of opening 10 locations in the Orlando area.
