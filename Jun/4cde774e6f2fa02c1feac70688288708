The Lightning’s fan base has grown during their run to the Stanley Cup final, expanding from Tampa Bay to at least one major sports book. Bettors have been active on the Lightning’s opponent, the Colorado Avalanche, which means a Tampa Bay loss would be costly to groups like BetMGM. “The Avalanche are the favorites to win the Stanley Cup and have been a big problem from a liability perspective since BetMGM posted opening odds,” sports trader Christian Cipollini said in a news release from the site. “The sportsbook is cheering for the Lightning to lift the Cup.” Colorado opened as the preseason favorite at plus-600 odds (meaning a $100 bet earns $600) and was the sportsbook’s biggest liability. More than a quarter (25.9%) of the bets were on the Avalanche; the Lightning had 11%, according to BetMGM. Worse for the sportsbook, 32.7% of the money was wagered on Colorado. Tampa Bay is at 14.9%. The latest odds from BetMGM have Colorado as the favorite (minus-160 money line) and continue to give the sportsbook a reason to root for Tampa Bay. Two-thirds of the money has been wagered on the Avalanche to win the series, even though only 52% of the bets have been on Colorado. • • • Sign up for Lightning Strikes, a weekly newsletter from Bolts beat writer Eduardo A.
