ST. PETERSBURG — The Rays are looking to complete a sweep of the Cardinals today, though their day started with bad news as Andrew Kittredge, one of their top relievers, is headed back to the injured list due to a right elbow issue. He is expected to be out at least a month. Kittredge has a loose body in his elbow and is highly likely to have arthroscopic surgery to remove it, manager Kevin Cash said. That is similar to what starter Shane Baz had in March, and he is just now ready to rejoin the rotation. Kittredge had just returned from the injured list Sunday after missing about two weeks with low back discomfort. He pitched Sunday and Tuesday, and after the last outing reported elbow discomfort, with an MRI showing the loose body, which is often a bone chip. Calvin Faucher, who has been with the Rays twice previously, was recalled to take Kittredge’s spot in the bullpen, which also recently lost JP Feyereisen (shoulder bone bruise). The Rays have top starter Shane McClanahan on the mound today vs. St. Louis’ Miles Mikolas. Also today, the Rays will show a scoreboard video tribute after the second inning acknowledging Cardinals stars Yadier Molina and Albert Pujols, who are retiring after this season.
