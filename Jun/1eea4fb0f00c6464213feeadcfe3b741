Hurricane forecasters are watching a patch of rough weather in the southwest Caribbean that could strengthen into a tropical depression later this week. “Further development of this system is possible while it drifts northwestward near the coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras, and it could become a tropical depression later this week if the disturbance remains over  water,” the National Hurricane Center said in its 2 p.m. Tuesday advisory. The chances of that happening by Thursday afternoon are about 30 percent. The chances of that happening by Sunday are about 40 percent, forecasters said. The system could produce heavy rain across eastern Nicaragua and Honduras later this week. There’s no indication if the weather will pose a threat to Florida in the future. An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate this system Wednesday. • • • 2022 Tampa Bay Times Hurricane Guide IT'S STORM SEASON: Get ready and stay informed at tampabay.com/hurricane.
