ST. PETERSBURG — Left-hander Jalen Beeks will be the opener for the Rays when they take on the Yankees tonight at Tropicana Field. The Rays had considered calling up lefty Josh Fleming from Triple-A Durham but opted instead to have Beeks work the first couple of innings and then use an assortment of relievers. They used a similar strategy against the Yankees last Thursday in New York. With outfielders Manuel Margot (right knee) and Kevin Kiermaier (left hip) placed on the injured list, the Rays called up lefty-hitting infielder Jonathan Aranda and outfielder Luke Raley. Lefty Nestor Cortes is starting for the Yankees, and the Rays have seven right-handed hitters or switch-hitters in their lineup. Another, Rene Pinto, is on the bench. Here is the Rays’ lineup: Yankees lineup when available. • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
