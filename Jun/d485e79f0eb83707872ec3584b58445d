TAMPA — The famed Rob Gronkowski spikes are done — for now. The tight end announced his retirement from the NFL via social media on Tuesday afternoon. The four-time All-Pro spent two seasons with the Bucs after nine seasons with the Patriots. On Gronkowski’s Instagram post announcing his retirement, longtime friend and teammate Tom Brady commented, “Love you as a man, teammate and friend. One of a kind in every way,” followed by a red heart emoji. Gronkowski had 100 catches for 1,425 yards and 13 touchdowns in 28 regular-season games over two seasons with the Bucs, helping the team to a Super Bowl 55 title with a 31-9 win over Kansas City.
