Award-winning musician and actor Demi Lovato — who identifies as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns — is bringing their Holy Fvck tour with rock band Dead Sara to the Hard Rock Event Center at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Tampa on Oct. 28. Tickets start at $75 and go on sale at 10 a.m. June 10 via seminolehardrocktampa.com and ticketmaster.com. Lovato is known for their musical versatility and genre blending with such hits as “Skyscraper,” “Sorry Not Sorry” and the queer anthem “Cool for the Summer.” Their seven studio albums all debuted in the Top 5 of the Billboard 200, with four albums earning more than 1 billion streams on Spotify. The tour is in support of their upcoming studio album “Holy Fvck,” in which Lovato goes back to their rock and pop-punk roots and explores an “earnest, yet tongue-in-cheek retrospective of their life experiences.”
