With a marquee opponent in the New York Rangers and no COVID-19 capacity restrictions in place at Amalie Arena, the Lightning’s drive for a third straight Stanley Cup final has sent ticket prices and TV ratings soaring. The average prices for resale tickets for Games 3 and 4 of the Eastern Conference finals this week in Tampa were $467 and $455, respectively, according to secondary marketplace StubHub. That’s up from $299 and $301 in Games 1 and 2 last year, when the Lightning faced another New York team, the Islanders, in the conference finals. This year’s higher prices come despite more seats being available than last year, when Amalie Arena was operating at about 78% capacity for the conference finals. But they’re also way up over 2018, when the Lightning lost in the conference finals to the Washington Capitals, the eventual champion. “Ticket prices in this series have trended slightly higher for the games in New York, given the Rangers haven’t advanced this far since 2015, but we’re also seeing strong demand in Tampa in comparison to past years,” StubHub spokesperson Michael Silveira said. “Ticket sales for Games 3 and 4 in Tampa outpaced sales for the first Lightning home games of the 2018 Conference Finals against the Capitals by over 40% on StubHub.” By Thursday afternoon, resale tickets were averaging around $420 on StubHub for tonight’s Game 5 in New York and $237 for Saturday’s Game 6 in Tampa, but those will rise as game time nears. Between June 3 and Tuesday, ticket prices for Game 4 at Amalie rose 120%. Interest in the series isn’t limited to ticket resales. Ratings for the first four games are through the roof, with ESPN averaging more than 2.2 million viewers per game. That’s up 71% from last year’s Eastern Conference final, and up 24% over 2019. The first Lightning-Rangers game on June 1 set a cable record for the most-viewed Game 1 of any conference final, Eastern or Western, with an average of 2.4 million viewers, up 34% from 2021. The second and fourth games, which both drew an average of 2.3 million viewers, were the highest-rated games 2 and 4 on cable since 2013. Ratings for both were up more than 70% over last year. What’s not evident is whether all this fan demand has translated to more visitors from out of town. Hillsborough County hotel room occupancy on game nights during the first two rounds of the playoffs increased between 2% and 10% from the same nights in 2021, according to Visit Tampa Bay. But hotel occupancy has been up across the board year over year, as pandemic travel concerns and restrictions have ebbed. During March, occupancy was up more than 21% over 2021, the agency reported.
