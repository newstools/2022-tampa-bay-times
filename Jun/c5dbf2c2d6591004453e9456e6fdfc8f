ST. PETERSBURG — The Rays have been insisting it was just a matter of time until their offense broke out of an extended slump. After beating the Cardinals 11-3 Wednesday, they now hope it is the start of something. The 11 runs were their most in a game this season, surpassing their 10 in a 10-inning game May 3 vs. Oakland. The 18 hits also were a season high, surpassing the 14 in that same game against the A’s. So were their seven doubles. And it was the first time all nine starters in their lineup had a hit in the same game since August. Manuel Margot led the way, going 4-for-5 plus a walk and scoring two runs. Ji-Man Choi was 3-for-5, knocking in two runs and scoring three. Randy Arozarena, facing his former Cardinals team, also had three hits. The Rays (33-23) had some help from an ineffective Cardinals pitching performance led by opener Packy Naughton and some uncharacteristically sloppy defense. That included reliever T.J. McFarland apparently losing track of the outs in the sixth inning and casually throwing to first after fielding a bases-loaded comebacker, allowing a run to score. Star catcher Yadier Molina took a turn on the mound, striking out Isaac Paredes in working a scoreless eighth. The Rays got a quick start, scoring three in the first and added on from there. Margot led off with a single, Choi doubled him in with one out and, with two down, Arozarena and Vidal Brujan delivered run-scoring doubles. They added single runs in the second and third, then three more in the seventh to break it open. Corey Kluber started and worked into the sixth for the Rays. • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
