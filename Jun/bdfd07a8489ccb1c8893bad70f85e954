A 57-year-old Wimauma man is dead after a crash on U.S. 301 in Hillsborough County Monday afternoon, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. A 21-year-old Wimauma man was heading east on Lightfoot Road when he stopped his sedan at the U.S. 301 intersection and began to turn left around 12:02 p.m., troopers said. As he turned, the 21-year-old driver crossed into the path of the 57-year-old man’s dump truck, which was southbound, according to the Highway Patrol. The 57-year-old man drove onto the west shoulder of the road to avoid the sedan, then overcorrected and ended up on the east shoulder, where his truck overturned. The 57-year-old man died at the scene, troopers said. The 21-year-old sedan driver was not injured.
