The Gators picked up a big, local commitment Tuesday when Lakewood High’s Isaiah Nixon flipped from UCF to Florida. The 6-foot-4, 215-pound edge rusher is a four-star recruit in the class of 2023. He is the nation’s No. 194 prospect in the 247Sports composite rankings and No. 26 at his position. As a junior, he recorded 75 tackles (24 for a loss), 10 sacks and two forced/recovered fumbles. Nixon committed to the Knights in April but decommitted Monday after a weekend visit to UF. Some of his other reported offers include USC, Alabama, Auburn, Georgia and Florida State. Nixon becomes the top-rated commitment of the seven who have pledged to the Gators in this class. His addition will boost UF to No. 39 in the early class rankings. It’s also a sign that the Gators are having some success living up to first-year coach Billy Napier’s plan of recruiting the state and Tampa Bay area heavily. “I think we very much want to build our team inside-out, and that’s not just a slogan. That’s based off a lot of research,” Napier said this spring at a speaking stop at Armature Works. “And certainly when Florida’s had success, you’ve got to start in your back yard. And we would say two and a half hours up the road, two hours up the road, this is our back yard to some degree.” Oral commitments are non-binding until recruits sign with colleges during their senior year. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
