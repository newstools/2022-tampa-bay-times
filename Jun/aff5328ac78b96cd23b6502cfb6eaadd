ST. PETERSBURG — Wander Franco has officially returned to the Rays. The 21-year-old phenom was activated off the injured  list and is in the lineup for today’s 1:40 p.m. game against the Pirates. He is second in the order and will play shortstop. Franco has been out since May 31 with a right quad strain, and he was limited by the injury before he moved to the IL. “I feel good, thank God,” Franco said Sunday morning via team interpreter Manny Navarro. Franco had a five-game rehab assignment. He went 3-for-9 in his three appearances with Triple-A Durham. He said that he felt ready Thursday, after his second rehab game at that level. To prevent a similar injury, Franco said he will focus on his pregame routine and warmups a little more. Franco said the experience was frustrating because it was the first time he had been down for so long. “But I’m here,” he said, “and I’m ready to go.” To make room for Franco, the Rays optioned infielder Jonathan Aranda to Durham. Aranda was 2-for-3 with an RBI in two games with Tampa Bay. Franco’s return is expected to be a big boost for a team that went 14-18 when he was out or limited to designated hitter. “Everyone knows how special that guy is and what he can bring to this team,” pitcher Shane Baz said. • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
