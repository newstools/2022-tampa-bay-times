Hitchcock’s Green Market at St. Petersburg’s Tyrone Square Mall is closing — the second grocery store in two years to do so at that location. The store at 6765 22nd Ave. N is closing “most likely this month,” according to senior vice president of operations Giselle Alvarez, whose father, Carlos, bought the 77-year-old chain in 2019. Everything inside is currently on sale for up to 50 percent off. “We do not have an exact closing date yet,” Alvarez said. “It will depend on how quickly we can sell the product we have in store.” Hitchcock’s opened in summer 2020, just a couple of months after a trendy Lucky’s Market exited the space and closed all its stores in Florida. Hitchcock’s, based in Alachua, has 11 locations throughout Florida, mostly in rural locations. It had attracted a following in west St. Petersburg for its butcher’s selection and other products not sold in nearby stores. Hitchcock’s Green Market will have adjusted hours of 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. until it closes.
