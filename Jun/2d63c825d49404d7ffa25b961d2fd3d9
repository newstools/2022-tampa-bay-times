A high-speed chase across the Howard Frankland Bridge early Saturday morning ended in a fatal crash, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. A trooper spotted a 2003 Lexus ES300 driving erratically along Interstate 275 near milepost 30 Friday at 1:14 a.m., according to a media release. Suspecting the driver was impaired, the trooper attempted a traffic stop. But the 33-year-old man from St. Petersburg behind the wheel fled at a high speed across the Howard Frankland, the release said. The car stopped at the Tampa International Airport where two adult women got out of the car, troopers said. Then the driver “intentionally” reversed the car and collided with the front of a trooper patrol car, the release said. The Lexus then fled southbound in the northbound lanes of George J. Bean Parkway, and struck a Chevy Silverado nearly head on that was traveling north, troopers said. The truck rotated into the shoulder and struck a guardrail. The 46-year-old man from Riverview driving the truck sustained minor injuries. The driver of the Lexus later died at a hospital from injuries related to the crash, troopers said. No other details, including the names of the people involved, were released by the highway patrol.
