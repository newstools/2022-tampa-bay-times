Delray Beach Police are searching for “Jack Ass” star Bam Margera after he escaped from a Florida drug rehabilitation center Monday, a department spokesperson confirmed. TMZ reports Margera left the center in a black sedan Monday after complaining to the manager he was unhappy with their services and was going to find a different facility. Margera was under a court order to be in rehab after a disturbance at the Don CeSar Resort Hotel in St. Pete Beach, according to TMZ. The Tampa Bay Times has requested a copy of the incident report from The Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office, but it has not yet been provided.
