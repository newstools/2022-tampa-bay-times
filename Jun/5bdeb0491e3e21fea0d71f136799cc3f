Busch Gardens is having a flash sale through Sunday night on its two-park Fun Card with Adventure Island water park for $99. It would normally cost $129.99 for just a Busch Gardens Fun Card, and the two-park pass is $179.99, so the sale through midnight Sunday saves $80. The park has started its Summer Celebration, which brings fireworks and live entertainment on weekends through Labor Day. And free beer is back through Aug. 7, a nod to the park’s brewery roots. Guests who are 21 and older can get a complimentary 7-ounce beer daily at Pantopia Drinks & Snacks. Also new this summer is a lineup of rotating performances from NBC’s “America’s Got Talent” such as the Chicago Boyz acrobatic team, kicking off this week in Pantopia Theater. Tickets are available for purchase at BuschGardensTampa.com. Busch Gardens is owned by SeaWorld Entertainment, and sister park SeaWorld Orlando is also having a flash sale. The park is offering daily tickets for $55, originally priced at $124.99, and a two-park ticket for $99. That deal can include Busch Gardens, Aquatica Orlando or Adventure Island. See seaworld.com/orlando/tickets for information.
