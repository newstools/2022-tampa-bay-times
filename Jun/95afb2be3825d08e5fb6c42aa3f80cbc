TAMPA — Amid a tough Stanley Cup final series against the Avalanche, tonight’s NHL Awards could be a bright spot for the Lightning. Victor Hedman is one of three finalists for the Norris Trophy, which recognizes the league’s best defenseman of the regular season. Colorado’s Cale Makar and Nashville’s Roman Josi are also up for the award. The ceremony at Tampa’s Armature Works starts at 7 tonight. With host Kenan Thompson, winners for the Norris, Vezina (best goaltender), Hart (MVP), Calder (rookie of the year) and Ted Lindsay (most outstanding player as voted by the NHL Players’ Association) awards will be named. Hedman, 31, is a finalist for the sixth consecutive season after posting a career regular season with 20 goals and 65 assists for 85 points (behind Josi’s 23-73—96 and Makar’s 28-58—86). This year’s run was all the more impressive for Hedman as he came off meniscus surgery in the offseason following the team’s second Stanley Cup run. A Norris win would mark the second of Hedman’s career (also 2017-18 season). This postseason, Hedman has recorded the third-most points (2-15—17) behind Makar (7-19—26) and New York’s Adam Fox (5-18—23).
