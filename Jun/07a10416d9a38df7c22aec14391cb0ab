What’s not to love about blueberries? They’re healthy, full of antioxidants to ward off disease. They’re available year-round, thanks to new strains developed by the University of Florida that thrive in the state’s mild winters. And they’re versatile, easy to toss onto cereal, bake into delicious goodies or mix with other berries for tall, cool drinks. Whether planning a Fourth of July party or just relaxing by the pool on a lazy summer day, you’re sure to enjoy these tasty treats based on recipes from Wish Farms, one of Florida’s leading berry growers.
