ST. PETERSBURG — The morning after watching their bullpen squander a sparkling effort by starter Drew Rasmussen, the Rays have activated high-leverage reliever Andrew Kittredge from the injured list. To make room for Kittredge, who had been dealing with back tightness and hasn’t worked in a game since May 16, the team optioned right-hander Calvin Faucher to Triple-A Durham. “Feel good, yeah,” said Kittredge, 3-1 with five saves in 15 appearances. “I guess (I’ve) kind of got to wait to see how it feels on the game mound, but the two rehab games I felt really good, so I like where I’m at and hopefully it just translates to the game mound here.” Additionally, infielder Taylor Walls has returned to the lineup after fouling a ball off his right calf Wednesday against the Rangers. Walls starts at shortstop today against the White Sox in the rubber match of the teams’ three-game series. “I think he’s feeling better,” manager Kevin Cash said before the game. “When he fouled that ball off his calf, it was very much more muscle than bone, and it just got really tight. It was like a golf ball in there, and I think that’s gone away. I would imagine he’s going to be moving pretty good; maybe not 100 percent, but good enough to go out there and play.” Here are today’s lineups.
