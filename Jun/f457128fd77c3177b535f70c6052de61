A pedestrian was hit and killed Sunday evening after she was hit by one of two vehicles that had just been involved in a car crash, the Florida Highway Patrol said. The incident occurred at 5:20 p.m. Sunday at the intersection of Oakmont Avenue and Anclote Boulevard, which is in the Tarpon Springs area. Troopers said the pedestrian who was killed is a 42-year-old woman from Dickson, Tennessee, who was walking along the shoulder of Anclote Boulevard when she was hit. The crash occurred after a 24-year-old Holiday woman “failed to yield” to another vehicle at an intersection that has a stop sign, troopers said. She was driving a car north on Oakmont south of Anclote, while a sport utility vehicle driven by a 51-year-old woman from Holiday was traveling west on Anclote east of Oakmont. The vehicles crashed, at which point the SUV rotated and hit the pedestrian. She was taken to a hospital, where she died. Neither the driver of the car or the SUV were injured, troopers said. Two passengers in the SUV — a 51-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy — also were not injured, troopers said. Other details, including the names of the people involved and whether charges will be filed, were not released by troopers.
