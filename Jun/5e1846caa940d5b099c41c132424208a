TAMPA — The Lightning’s chance at a three-peat comes with hurdles. Following Tampa Bay’s 7-0 loss at Colorado on Saturday night, the Lightning find themselves in a 2-0 series hole for the second time this postseason (also in the Eastern Conference final against the Rangers). The Avalanche and Lightning will meet again Monday for Game 3 at Amalie Arena. For the second straight game, goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy — who played in his 100th career postseason contest Saturday — allowed three first-period goals. Saturday was the second time in his 465-game career in which he allowed seven goals (also Feb. 22, 2020, at Arizona). Meanwhile, the Avalanche’s 11 goals in two games are the most through the start of a Cup final series since the last time the franchise accomplished the feat in 1996.
