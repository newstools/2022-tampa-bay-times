BALTIMORE — The Rays are looking to put a good finish on a rough road trip this afternoon when they face the Orioles, first pitch at 1:35 p.m. Veteran Corey Kluber will be on the mound for the Rays, having pitched well for most of the season but not here at Camden Yards. On a hot May 22, Kluber lasted just three innings, throwing 73 pitches while allowing two runs with five hits and two walks. In four starts since then, he is 2-1 with a 1.98 ERA, facing the Rangers, Cardinals and Yankees. The Orioles appear to be going with a bullpen day. Right-hander Jordan Lyles had been scheduled to start but was scratched due to a stomach virus. Reliever Austin Voth will start in a bullpen day arrangement. Rays manager Kevin Cash said he felt their lineup was balanced enough that he didn’t need to make any changes. The Rays are 2-6 so far on the nine-game road trip, losing two of three at Minnesota, getting swept in three games at Yankee Stadium and splitting the first two games against the Orioles.
