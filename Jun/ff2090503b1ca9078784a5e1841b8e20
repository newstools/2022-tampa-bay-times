MINNEAPOLIS — The Rays are looking to avoid being swept in a series for the first time in nearly a year when they take on the Twins today. Left-hander Jeffrey Springs, coming off a six-shutout-inning performance against the Cardinals that was the best of his six starts, will be on the mound for the Rays. Right-hander Cole Sands, a former Florida State teammate of Taylor Walls, will start for the Twins. Manuel Margot is back in the designated hitter spot as the Rays continue to try to limit his running, specifically his quick bursts, following his injured-list stint for a hamstring strain. The Rays have not been swept in a series since a two-game set June 29-30, 2021 at Washington and not in a three-or-more-game series since June 17-20, 2021 at Seattle. This is the third time they went into the final game of a road series this year needing a win to avoid a sweep, having done so at the White Sox and Angels. Manager Kevin Cash said a win would give the team some momentum going into the three-game series that opens Tuesday at Yankee Stadium (following Monday’s off day). The Rays will host the Yankees in a three-game series next week at Tropicana Field.
