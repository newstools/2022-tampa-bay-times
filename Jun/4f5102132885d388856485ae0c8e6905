When the Tampa Bay Times newsroom kicked off a week-long annual fundraiser, we set a goal of $50,000. And, wow, did our readers respond. We raised $121,370, and checks are still arriving. More than 500 individuals made contributions online, ranging from $10 to $5,000. We received $52,490 through our campaign portal. Another $9,395 came to us through our main donation page at tampabay.com. And as of Friday, we logged an additional $59,485 in checks mailed to us, including one for $50,000 from The Yerrid Foundation, a nonprofit chaired by prominent Tampa attorney Steve Yerrid. We are incredibly grateful. All the proceeds will help pay for local news gathering. The amount raised during this campaign is enough to fund two journalists for a year. Since our fundraising drive closed, some of you have asked if you can still contribute. You can. Just go to www.tampabay.com/donate for the details. You can also reach out to Annica Keeler, our director of development and community relations, at akeeler@tampabay.com or by phone at 727-892-2264 From all of us at the Times, we want to extend our heartfelt appreciation for your support and encouragement. Thank you!
