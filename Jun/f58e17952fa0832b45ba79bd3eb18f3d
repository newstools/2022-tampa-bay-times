The University of South Florida this week announced leadership changes at its Muma College of Business following news that the college’s longtime dean, Moez Limayem, will be leaving to become president at the University of North Florida. GJ de Vreede will serve as interim dean. He is currently the associate dean for research and professional programs and a professor in the School of Information Systems and Management. Gary Patterson will become the college’s St. Petersburg campus dean and serve as dean of the Kate Tiedemann School of Business and Finance. He takes that post after serving as interim dean following the departure of Sridhar Sundaram, who left to take a dean position at California State University, Fullerton. Joni Jones, an associate professor in the School of Information Systems and Management, will become campus dean for the Muma College of Business in Sarasota-Manatee. Jones replaces Jean Kabongo, who will become associate dean for academic affairs and accreditation and chief diversity officer. USF president Rhea Law announced last month that the university would conduct a nationwide search to replace Limayem.
