MINNEAPOLIS — The Rays’ nine-game, 10-day road trip got off to a rough start with news Friday afternoon that All-Star catcher Mike Zunino was placed on the 10-day injured list due to left shoulder inflammation. Rookie Rene Pinto, who played in five games during a late April/early May stint, was called up from Triple-A. The issue has apparently been bothering Zunino for a while — Pinto was flown to Texas during the last road trip and placed on the taxi squad in case he was needed — but the Rays seem confident as of now that Zunino’s stay on the injured list will be short. Drew Rasmussen, who made his big-league debut at Target Field in 2020 when he was with Milwaukee, will start tonight for the Rays, coming off a solid last outing, bouncing back from a rough one the time before. “It’s where I debuted, so it’s pretty cool,” Rasmussen said. His biggest memory? “No fans.” Lefty Devin Smeltzer will be on the mound for the Twins, who lost two of last three to the Yankees, and 10 of their last 16. The Twins took two of three from the Rays earlier this season at the Trop. “We saw them earlier and they played well against us,” manager Kevin Cash said. “When they’re healthy, their offense is really challenging to navigate through, and they’ve got some young pitchers we’re not all too familiar with.” Here is the Rays lineup: • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
