TAMPA — For the first time since Round 1, the Lightning are using a traditional lineup (12 forwards and six defensemen) for today’s Game 3 against the Rangers, who lead the series 2-0. With the new look, Riley Nash gets his first action of the postseason. Brandon Hagel, battling through an undisclosed injury, also made the lineup. Defenseman Cal Foote was listed as a healthy scratch for the extra forward (missing his first game of the playoffs). During pre-game warmups, Nash skated on the fourth line with Pierre-Edouard Bellemare and Pat Maroon. Meanwhile, Hagel skated with Alex Killorn and Anthony Cirelli. The Lightning have opted for an adjusted lineup of 11 forwards and seven defensemen for the past six games after losing Brayden Point, who remains out with a lower-body injury, during Game 7 against the Maple Leafs. It worked in the team’s four-game sweep over Florida, but has been ineffective in two games against New York. Nash has played in 34 career postseason games over his 11-year career, logging two goals and six assists. This year, he posted four assists in 49 regular-season games.
