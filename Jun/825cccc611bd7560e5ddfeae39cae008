NEW YORK — The Rays are looking to avoid being swept by the Yankees tonight and will have to do so without centerfielder Kevin Kiermaier in the lineup. Kiermaier left Wednesday’s game in the third inning when left calf/Achilles tightness that had been bothering him for a week or so got worse. With scheduled Thursday starter Drew Rasmussen placed on the injured list due to a hamstring strain, the Rays will go with somewhat of a bullpen-day arrangement. Lefty Jalen Beeks will be the opener, and right-hander Ralph Garza Jr. is expected to work bulk innings. The Yankees are starting right-hander Luis Severino. In an effort to change the look of what has been a quiet offense, manager Kevin Cash moved rookie switch-hitter Vidal Brujan to the leadoff spot.
