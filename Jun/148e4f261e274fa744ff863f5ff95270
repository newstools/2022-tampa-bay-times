The Department of Justice announced Wednesday that a team of experts will assist in a review of the police response to the Uvalde school shooting, including Laura McElroy, a former Tampa police spokesperson and Tampa Bay TV reporter. McElroy trains law enforcement agencies across the country in crisis communications and media relations, according to a website for her consulting company. She and eight other experts were chosen to help support the critical incident review being conducted by the DOJ’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. In a news release, the DOJ said the review “will examine issues including policies, training, communications, deployment and incident command, tactics, and practices as they relate to preparing for and responding to active shooter events, as well as the post-incident response. It will also include a review of survivor and victim family support and resources.” Questions have arisen over the law enforcement response to the deadly rampage at the Texas elementary school, which left 19 students and two teachers dead. The New York Times reported Thursday that police waited more than an hour before entering the school and confronting the gunman, despite knowing that injured people were in need of medical help. “I’m committed to drawing on my experience developing national best practices in transparency and accountability for law enforcement,” McElroy told the Tampa Bay Times in an email.
