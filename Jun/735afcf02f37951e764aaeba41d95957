BALTIMORE — The Rays had to be happy to escape from New York after being swept by the Yankees in three close games and are turning to rookie right-hander Shane Baz to give them a solid start tonight against the Orioles. Baz, who turned 23 today, had a rough season debut Saturday in Minnesota, retiring the first six Twins, then allowing the first six he faced to open the third inning to reach base. Five scored before he was removed. Baz, who underwent arthroscopic surgery in March to remove a loose body from his elbow, said he felt fine physically. He said he doesn’t need to make any mechanical adjustments, just do a better job with his approach toward throwing strikes. Centerfielder Kevin Kiermaier is out of the Rays lineup for a second straight day after leaving Wednesday’s game in the third inning due to left Achilles/calf tightness. He said Thursday that he had hoped a night of rest and treatment would allow to return to the lineup tonight. Offense has been an issue for the Rays, and manager Kevin Cash continues to search for a lineup combination that can be productive. He is giving rookie Vidal Brujan a second straight start in the leadoff spot.
