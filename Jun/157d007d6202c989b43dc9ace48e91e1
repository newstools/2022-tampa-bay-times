TAMPA — Star center Brayden Point will be a game-time decision for Game 3 of the Stanley Cup final, Lightning coach Jon Cooper said this morning. The Avalanche lead the best-of-seven series 2-0 entering tonight’s game at Amalie Arena. Point was one of two players absent from this morning’s full-team skate, along with goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy, who will start in net. Point, who led the NHL with 14 goals each of the past two postseasons, missed 10 games with a lower-body injury sustained during Game 7 of the opening round before returning for the first game of the Cup final. He picked up one assist while averaging 17:20 over the first two games of the series. Earlier in the postseason, he had two goals and two assists in the seven-game, first-round victory over the Maple Leafs. If Point misses tonight’s game, the Lightning could add forward Riley Nash to the lineup. Nash, who played the final four games of the Eastern Conference final against the Rangers, was on the ice for the morning skate. Another option would be an adjusted lineup of 11 forwards and seven defensemen, which the Lightning used throughout the second-round sweep of the Panthers. Scratching the 12th forward could mean defenseman Cal Foote returning to the lineup for the first time since Game 2 of the conference final. During the morning skate, Corey Perry filled in on the slot position on the top power-play unit, where Point typically plays. Perry scored two power-play goals with that unit earlier in the postseason. • • • Sign up for Lightning Strikes, a weekly newsletter from Bolts beat writer Eduardo A.
