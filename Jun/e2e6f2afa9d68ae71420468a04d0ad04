TALLAHASSEE — Gov. Ron DeSantis praised the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade on Friday, saying, “The prayers of millions have been answered.” “For nearly fifty years, the U.S. Supreme Court has prohibited virtually any meaningful pro-life protection, but this was not grounded in the text, history or structure of the Constitution,” DeSantis said in a statement on Twitter. “By properly interpreting the Constitution, the Dobbs majority has restored the people’s role in our republic and a sense of hope that every life counts.” The governor said he would “work to expand pro-life protections” but was not specific about what that would entail. “Florida will continue to defend its recently-enacted pro-life reforms against state court challenges, will work to expand pro-life protections, and will stand for life by promoting adoption, foster care and child welfare.” In April, DeSantis signed into law a bill passed by the Florida Legislature banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Last year, DeSantis joined 10 other Republican governors on a brief to the Supreme Court arguing justices should reconsider the Roe decision and the 1992 case Planned Parenthood of Southeast Pennsylvania v. Casey, which reaffirmed Roe while making it easier for states to legally pass some abortion regulations.
