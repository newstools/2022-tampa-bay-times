A planned visit to the southwest Caribbean on Wednesday by the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter Aircraft was canceled after a blob of rough weather showed fewer signs of potentially strengthening. In its 8 a.m. advisory Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said the weather only has a 20 percent chance of tropical formation by Friday and only a 30 percent of forming by Monday. Those numbers were down from the 30 and 40 percent chances that forecasters gave the system of strengthening on Tuesday. “The disturbance is expected to meander slowly today, then drift northwestward along the coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras later this week,” the hurricane center said in the Wednesday morning advisory. “Some slow development of this system is still possible if it moves back over water.” Forecasters say the weather, regardless of development, could produce heavy rain over eastern Nicaragua and Honduras later this week. There were no indications Wednesday morning if the weather will ever present a threat to Florida. • • • 2022 Tampa Bay Times Hurricane Guide IT'S STORM SEASON: Get ready and stay informed at tampabay.com/hurricane.
