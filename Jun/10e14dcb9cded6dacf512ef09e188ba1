Crews battled a two-alarm fire at an apartment complex in Tampa’s Bayshore district Tuesday afternoon, according to Tampa Fire Rescue. Firefighters were called to the Kansas Avenue Apartments on West Kansas Avenue around 2:30 p.m., according to Fire Rescue spokesperson Vivian McIlrath. Smoke was coming from the roof when first responders arrived, and it appears that the fire started there, she said. Firefighters used two trucks to spray water onto the roof from all angles as they tried to extinguish the flames, McIlrath said. Debbi Copeland says her daughter Lauren Copeland, a resident of the building, wasn’t home when the fire started. After property managers sent a text to Lauren Copeland to alert her about it, she texted her mom. “She didn’t know if the text was spam or fake or what, so I told her I would go and check it out for her,” Debbi Copeland said. “When I got here I saw all these firetrucks and smoke, so I knew something was wrong.” She said firefighters told her the building was at risk of completely collapsing and no one would be allowed inside. It’s a “total loss,” Debbi Copeland said. “She lost everything — they all did.” All occupants were safely evacuated and there have been no injuries reported to residents or firefighters at the scene, McIlrath said. South Carolina Avenue currently is closed in the area, the agency said in a tweet. Motorists are advised to avoid the area. The cause of the fire is under investigation.
