Construction work on the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway will bring overnight detours Sunday and Monday, the Tampa Hillsborough County Expressway Authority announced. Westbound traffic will be detoured off the expressway at 50th Street. The detour will send drivers to State Road 60 (Adamo Drive) and then back onto the expressway at 22nd Street. The tolls at 22nd Street will be waived during this time. On Sunday, the detour lasts from 8:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. and on Monday from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. The construction is part of an ongoing project to bring two new slip ramps between the main expressway and its reversible express lanes in the hope of easing morning congestion. Nighttime lane closures will occur throughout this project on an ongoing basis, according to Expressway Authority Communications Manager Sue Chrzan. Full construction began in January 2022 and is expected to finish in the fall of 2023.
