Universal has announced the return of Michael Myers to Halloween Horror Nights, with a haunted house inspired by the classic movie “Halloween.” John Carpenter’s 1978 slasher film, which was first featured as a haunted house at the theme park in 2014, returns with a maze “where guests come face-to-face with the merciless Michael Myers.” Universal Orlando’s popular separate-ticket event begins Sept. 2, taking advantage of the many iconic horror franchises the company has the rights to. “Halloween,” one of the most popular horror films of all time, has a new franchise trilogy that concludes with Universal’s release of “Halloween Ends” on Oct. 14. Another haunted house called “Universal Monsters: Legends Collide” was previously announced. It combines three of the Universal monsters — the Wolf Man, Dracula and the Mummy — into one new haunted house experience. Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios is set to feature 10 haunted houses, five scare zones and two live shows this year. This event will run through Oct. 31. Tickets and vacation packages that start at $73.99 per person are now on sale at HalloweenHorrorNights.com.
