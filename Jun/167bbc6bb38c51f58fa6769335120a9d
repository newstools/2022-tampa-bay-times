TAMPA — The Lightning retained some of their blue-line depth on Thursday, re-signing defenseman Darren Raddysh to a two-year, two-way contract. Raddysh, a 26-year-old with 289 AHL games under his belt, played four games for the Lightning last season, logging an average of 10:40 of ice time. He had six blocked shots, four hits, two shots on goal and a plus-1 rating. The Lightning go into the offseason with some uncertainty regarding how the right side of their defensive pairings could look next season. The team is looking to re-sign right-shot defenseman Jan Rutta, who is an unrestricted free agent, but Rutta could wind up being a salary-cap casualty. Former first-round draft pick Cal Foote, also a right-shot defenseman, improved his play in his second full NHL season but was a healthy scratch for the Lightning’s final 10 playoff games. Raddysh, the older brother of former Lightning forward Taylor Raddysh, proved to be a dependable defenseman at AHL Syracuse in his first year in the Lightning organization, posting seven goals and 18 assists in 61 games for the Crunch with a plus-4 rating. Following a litany of injuries to Lightning defensemen, Raddysh made his NHL debut on Dec. 30 against Florida. The Lightning also recently re-signed forward Simon Ryfors, who scored 11 goals and had 24 assists in 72 games with Syracuse in his first AHL season since coming over from Sweden, to a one-year, two-way contract. • • • Sign up for Lightning Strikes, a weekly newsletter from Bolts beat writer Eduardo A.
