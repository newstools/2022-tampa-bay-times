The greatest player in Bulls football history, Quinton Flowers, is being inducted into the USF Athletic Hall of Fame. Flowers will join former volleyball standout Erica Berggren and former athletic director Paul Griffin as this year’s inductees. Flowers starred at quarterback for the Bulls, twice earning all-American Athletic Conference recognition. The 2016 AAC offensive player of the year tied the school record with 30 wins and led USF to three bowl games. He left as the conference’s all-time leader in total offense (11,802 yards) and with 42 school records, including career marks in rushing yards (3,672), total touchdowns (112) and passing efficiency (146.51). Berggren was Conference USA’s player of the year in 1995 and ‘96 and helped the Bulls win three conference titles. She’s still the program’s career leader in hitting percentage (.415), blocks (626) and block assists (488). Griffin was the Bulls’ AD who helped the school add its football and women’s soccer programs. He also led the Bulls’ rise from the Sun Belt Conference to Conference USA. His notable hires include men’s basketball coach Bobby Paschal, who took USF to two NCAA Tournament appearances in a three-year span, plus softball coach Ken Eriksen and women’s basketball coach Jose Fernandez. “The tradition and legacy of USF Athletics continues to swell as we proudly welcome members of the 2022 Hall of Fame Class that have left truly memorable and transformational marks on USF Athletics,” USF athletic director Michael Kelly said in a statement. “The Hall of Fame inductions are tremendous celebrations of the great people and accomplishments that have defined USF Athletics, and we look forward with excitement to welcoming this class back to campus this fall.” • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
