A motorcyclist was killed in a crash at a Dunedin intersection Wednesday evening, the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office reported. Bryan Rogers, 49, was killed in the crash, which occurred about 6 p.m. at the intersection of Michigan Boulevard and County Road 1, the sheriff’s office said in a news release. Deputies said Cynthia Janssen, 58, was driving a 2013 black Mercedes sport utility vehicle north  on County Road 1 as Rogers was traveling south on the same roadway. The crash occurred after Janssen turned left to head west on Michigan Boulevard. Both north- and southbound lanes had a green light at the time, deputies said. Rogers was pronounced dead at the scene. Janssen was not injured, deputies said. Deputies said speed and impairment do not appear to be factors in the crash. No information about potential charges or citations was included in the news release, though deputies said an investigation remains in progress.
