A Tampa man who had been arrested in connection with a May homicide in Largo stabbed and shot the victim, who was his friend, court records show. Thomas Henderson, 27, has been charged with second-degree murder. New details about the case were made public Wednesday when Henderson was transferred from the Hillsborough County jail to the Pinellas County jail to await trial. When Eddie Allen Jr. didn’t show up for work on May 20, police did a welfare check at his mobile home at 1100 Donegan Road. The owner of the home found Allen naked on the living room floor with a pillow over his head. He had been stabbed in the neck and shot in the face, according to an autopsy. No guns were found in the home. Allen’s car was also missing from the property. Two days later, police tracked it to a parking lot at 704 E Hanna Ave in Tampa. They found Henderson inside the blue sedan and interviewed him. At first, Henderson told police he did not know the owner of the car and was in Hillsborough County at the time of the slaying. Later, he acknowledged Allen was a longtime friend that he had been staying with for about a week. Henderson said Allen had tried to attack him with a knife and gun while he was in the shower. Henderson said he stabbed Allen in the neck twice in self-defense. When he tried to slap the gun away from Allen, he said, it discharged and shot Allen in the face, killing him. Henderson then put a pillow over Allen face and fled. He said he did not go to the police about the incident because he was scared, records state. Henderson was initially booked into the Hillsborough County jail on May 22 on the murder charge along with charges of grand theft auto and violation of probation. He was transferred to the Pinellas County jail on Wednesday. Bail information was not immediately available.
