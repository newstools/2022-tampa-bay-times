A pedestrian was killed after being hit by at least one driver, and possibly two, in Temple Terrace on Monday morning, the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office said. Investigators with the Sheriff’s Office have not released the identity of the person who was struck and killed just after 5 a.m. Monday on Morris Bridge Road, near the intersection of Tampa Oaks Boulevard. Whether one driver or two contributed to the person’s death, no one stopped to check on the pedestrian’s well-being after striking them, the Sheriff’s Office said. The pedestrian died from their injuries at the scene. Investigators don’t know the make or model of the vehicle that was being driven by the person who initially struck the pedestrian and fled the scene, the Sheriff’s Office said, but they learned that the driver of a vehicle described as “possibly gray or silver in color” may have struck the person a second time. That vehicle also drove away. Investigators said they still are reviewing surveillance videos from nearby businesses and apartment buildings in the hopes of identifying the drivers responsible. Another driver saw the body on the roadway and called 911, the Sheriff’s Office said. It still was unclear Monday afternoon how long the person was left lying in the road before first responders arrived at the scene. Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister issued a statement Monday reminding drivers that it is a felony offense to leave the scene of a crash that causes injuries, “whether you are at fault or not.” “Please do the right thing and call law enforcement if you find yourself in a situation like that,” Chronister’s statement said. “It’s legally and morally the right thing to do.” Those with any information about the crash are asked to call the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office at 813-247-8200 or Crime Stoppers of Tampa Bay at 800-873-TIPS (8477).
