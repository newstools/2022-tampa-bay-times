EUGENE, Ore. — Florida won its first NCAA women’s outdoor track and field championship Saturday, adding to the indoor title it won this season. Florida finished with 74 points, 10 points ahead of Texas. Florida is the seventh program to sweep the outdoor team titles and the first since 2015. The Gators are the fourth program to win three of four track titles during a calendar year, also the first since 2015. Gators sophomore Talitha Diggs, daughter of four-time Olympian Joetta Clark Diggs, won the 400 meters in a personal best 49.99 seconds, adding to her 400 indoor title this season. The Gators also got individual national championships from Jasmine Moore in the triple jump and Anna Hall in the heptathlon. Kentucky junior Abby Steiner set a collegiate record in the 200 meters on a soggy day at Hayward Field. Her time of 21.80 seconds bested LSU sophomore Favour Ofili’s record of 21.96 set this year. Ofili was second behind Steiner. Julien Alfred of Texas won the 100, finishing in 11.014 seconds and just narrowly holding off Oregon’s Kemba Nelson in 11.020. BYU’s Kristie Schoffield  ran a personal-best 2 minutes, 1.09 seconds, in winning the 800, raising her hands to her mouth in surprise when she saw her time. Ole Miss sophomore Sintayehu Vissa won the 1,500 in 4:09.42. BYU senior Courtney Wayment built a big lead and won the steeplechase in 9:16 flat, a college and meet record. “The plan was to rely on my fitness and then all the things that I have done to get to this moment.” said Wayment, who shaved eight seconds off the college record. “If anyone is going to come with me, then I’ll just put my foot on the gas a little bit more.” LSU’s Alia Armstrong was the first to hit the first hurdle and went on to win the 100 hurdles in 12.57. Britton Wilson of Arkansas won the 400 hurdles in 53.86. North Carolina State’s Katelyn Tuohy defended her title in the 5,000, winning in 15:18.39. “My last 100 meters was so hard, I was practically crawling it in,” Tuohy said. “But I was fortunate enough to have a big enough gap before then so I was able to hold on.” Texas won the 400 relay in 42.42, and Kentucky won the 1,600 relay in 3:22.55. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
