Two people were injured after a crash on Interstate 275 in Hillsborough County early Friday morning caused by a driver going south in the northbound lanes, the Florida Highway Patrol reported. The crash occurred at 3:18 a.m. near Busch Boulevard. Troopers said a 55-year-old Tampa woman was driving a car south in the northbound lanes when she collided “nearly head-on” with a northbound pickup driven by a 42-year-old Tampa man, troopers said in a news release. The woman suffered serious injuries. The man in the pickup had minor injuries, troopers said. I-275 was closed until 5:20 a.m. as troopers investigated. Troopers said they suspect the woman driving the wrong way was impaired by drugs and alcohol. Troopers did not release the names of the people involved.
