After a scary couple of years, Walt Disney World has announced the 2022 return of Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party, a ticketed event that takes place after hours at the Magic Kingdom. For the past two years the popular party with trick-or-treat stations and themed fireworks and parades was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was replaced by the after-hours Boo Bash, which was toned down to small “cavalcades” of characters that would pop up randomly. This year the Not-So-Scary party brings back treat stations, Mickey’s Boo-To-You Halloween Parade, the Hocus Pocus Villain Spelltacular stage show and Disney’s Not-So-Spooky Spectacular fireworks. Visitors will also get the chance to have photo-ops with characters. It will be held from Aug. 12 to Oct. 31 and runs 7 p.m. to midnight. Ticket holders can enter the park starting at 4 p.m. It’s the only time of year guests can wear a costume to a Disney theme park. Tickets go on sale May 18, but guests at some Disney World hotels can purchase tickets starting May 12. Prices vary by date, ranging from $109 in August to $199 on Halloween night.
