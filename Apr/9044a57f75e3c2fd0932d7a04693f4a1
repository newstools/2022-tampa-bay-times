SAFETY HARBOR — City officials are looking for answers after they say the Safety Harbor Marina Park Fountain was “heavily vandalized” earlier this week. Parts of the fountain were ripped up sometime between 7 a.m. Sunday and 7:30 a.m. Monday, according to a Facebook post from the city Tuesday. The Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the vandalism, and Deputy Amanda Sinni told the Tampa Bay Times in an email that the incident occurred during the overnight hours. Safety Harbor city manager Matt Spoor said that concrete decorative caps lining the edge of the fountain were removed and thrown into the fountain, located at 110 Veterans Memorial Lane. In addition, some lighting fixtures and pipes inside the fountain also were damaged. Photos posted to the city’s Facebook page show some pieces of the fountain lying at the bottom of the water. Spoor also said some parts were found scattered on the ground around the fountain.     Spoor said much of the damage to the fountain has been fixed this week. However, the city has yet to fix the damage done to the top of the fountain. As of Friday, Spoor said he was unsure about what the final cost of repairs would be. Mayor Joe Ayoub said he expects the repair totals to “be in the thousands.” Ayoub said in the past, there have been minor instances of vandalism at some parks and at the Safety Harbor Library, but nothing to this degree. “I think it’s a shame that someone would be in a state of mind to destroy our beautiful property,” Ayoub said. “It’s too bad that person didn’t do something productive with that energy.” The Sheriff’s Office declined to provide additional details, citing it as an open investigation. Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff’s Office at 727-582-6200.
