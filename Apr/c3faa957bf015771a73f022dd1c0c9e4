TAMPA — Two off-ramps on Interstate 4 that were closed during rush-hour traffic Monday afternoon have reopened. The two westbound exits, for U.S. 301 and U.S. 91, were closed between 5 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., according to the Florida 511 website from the state Department of Transportation. State traffic cameras showed the interstate backed up as far as downtown Tampa — seven miles west of the crash — with vehicles barely moving. The Florida Highway Patrol has not released information about the crash. U.S. 301 is Exit 7 on I-4 and is a north-south highway that connects commuters in East Pasco County to Tampa. It typically is flush with traffic during rush hour, even without a crash present.
