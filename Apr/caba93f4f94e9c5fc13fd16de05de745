TAMPA — The 23-year-old right tackle began the day presuming he didn’t yet possess the clout or cachet worthy of his iconic quarterback’s cellphone number. “I don’t have Tom’s number,” Bucs All-Pro Tristan Wirfs acknowledged to reporters Tuesday when asked if he has kept in touch with Tom Brady this offseason. “I don’t think I’m there yet.” By dusk, he was. Early Tuesday evening, Brady shared a text message he sent Wirfs. Initially posing as a phone solicitor, the seven-time Super Bowl champion texted: “Tristan, we’ve been trying to reach you regarding your cars (sic) extended warranty. “Just kidding your car is fine ... it’s your favorite Qb.” Brady tacked on a laughter emoji at the end. Wirfs’ response: “Tommy!! (with two laughter emojis) “Sorry you’re (sic) mentions were probably blowing up today.” Wirfs’ sheepish suggestion that he hadn’t yet earned Brady’s number belies his two sparkling seasons as one of the future Hall of Famer’s steadiest protectors. The 13th overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft has played every regular-season offensive snap of the last two years, allowing only three sacks and being whistled for only three holding penalties in that span. “With (Brady) at the helm, everyone is always excited,” Wirfs said Tuesday, the second day of the opening phase of the team’s offseason program. “I was excited (about 2022) either way, but having Tom Brady back there and getting to protect him for one more year is pretty cool. I’ve got to go delete my Instagram post — I did a big thank you and everything, so I’ll have to postpone that.” • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
