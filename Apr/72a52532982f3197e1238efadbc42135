Following the lead of the federal Transportation Security Administration, mass transit agencies in three Tampa Bay area counties said Tuesday they are rescinding requirements for passengers to wear face coverings. Face masks are now optional on vehicles operated by the Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority, the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority and GOPASCO — the Pasco County Public Transportation System. The Hillsborough agency, known commonly by the acronym HART, said in an online blog post that it “will no longer require masks on board our buses, vans, and streetcars and at our facilities including work offices. HART operators will no longer be required to enforce the mask requirement on our vehicles.” The agency noted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continued to recommend that people wear masks in indoor public transportation environments. The authority said customers and employees are still welcome to wear masks in all settings. The Pinellas agency, likewise, said on Twitter that masks are now optional at all of its facilities and on board its vehicles. “Masks and social distancing are still encouraged,” the agency said. GOPASCO tweeted a rider alert that masks were optional and followed with a statement that cited the federal Centers for Disease Control recommendation that people continue to wear masks for indoor public transportation. The federal mandate had been in effect since February 2021. The local decisions came in light of a ruling Monday by U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle in Tampa that struck down a national mask mandate on airplanes and mass transit. The judge’s decision freed airlines, airports and mass transit systems to make their own decisions about mask requirements. The Centers for Disease Control had recently extended the mask mandate until May 3 to allow more time to study the BA.2 omicron subvariant of the coronavirus that is now responsible for the vast majority of cases in the U.S.
