SUNRISE — The Panthers clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs Thursday as they matched a franchise record with their 12th straight win, 5-2 over the Red Wings. Aleksander Barkov scored his 38th goal of the season as Florida also clinched the top spot in the Atlantic Division. “It means a lot,” said MacKenzie Weegar, who also scored. “We put a lot of hard work into the season, and locking up the division is a big accomplishment for us. But there’s obviously the bigger picture here, and we’ll enjoy that, locking up division and getting the home ice advantage for the playoffs here.” The Panthers matched the 12-game winning streak they posted from Dec. 15, 2015, to Jan. 10, 2016. “We kind of just took it game by game, and I’m happy we’re racking up the wins here,” Weegar said. “We’re a great team, and it’s obviously shown all year.” Jonathan Huberdeau had two assists and moved into a tie with Connor McDavid of idle Edmonton for the league lead in points at 113. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 28 shots for the Panthers. Tyler Bertuzzi and Sam Gagner scored for Detroit, and Alex Nedeljkovic stopped 22 shots. “(The Panthers) seemingly can create offense out of nothing,” Gagner said. “You feel like you’re playing well against them, they create odd-man breaks, and their defensive finds guys up ice open. Ultimately they found a way to break through.” • • • The Tampa Bay Times has commemorated the Lightning’s second consecutive Stanley Cup title with a new hardcover coffee table book, Striking Twice.
