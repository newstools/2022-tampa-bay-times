St. Petersburg theater company American Stage has announced that producing artistic director Rajendra Ramoon Maharaj “will step away for personal reasons, effective immediately.” Maharaj succeeded Stephanie Gularte as producing artistic director. He was selected from a nationwide search in July and started at the theater in October. “I would like to thank my American Stage colleagues, our local theater and community partners, and all those who have supported me during my fruitful time here. I wish American Stage much success,” Maharaj said in a news release. Anastasia Hiotis, the organization’s board of trustees chair, said in the release, “On behalf of the board, I would like to thank Rajendra for the work he has done for our organization and for sharing his talents with the Tampa Bay community. We wish him success in his future endeavors.” Hiotis went on to say the board is excited about the future of American Stage. The board named managing director CJ Zygadlo as interim executive director, and will conduct a nationwide search for a new artistic leader.
