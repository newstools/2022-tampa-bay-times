All the people moving into and around Tampa Bay are going to need trucks to haul their stuff. Penske Truck Leasing wants to be ready for when it happens. Penske has opened a new 28,406-square-foot truck rental and maintenance facility on 11.15 acres of land at 7140 E Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. With five service bays, an automated wash bay system and mobile truck lifts, the facility will offer not just truck leasing but maintenance and fleet management services, the company said in an announcement. “We’ve been growing in the region and required a larger space to accommodate our increasing customer base,” Joe Hill, senior vice president of Penske’s southeast region, said in a statement. “Our new, enhanced facility is conveniently located near major highways and downtown Tampa easing accessibility for both our commercial and consumer rental customers.” This is the second major Tampa project for Penske in the last three years. In 2020, the company opened a technology center at 5401 W Kennedy Blvd. that now employs 75 people in software development and cybersecurity. With both new projects open, the company is currently hiring for an array of positions, from drivers and mechanics to technology and data engineers.
