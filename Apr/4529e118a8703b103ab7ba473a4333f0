TAMPA ― Giovani Bernard was expected to become the type of pass-catching running back that Tom Brady relied on with the Patriots for most of his career. He had some moments. He caught nine passes for 51 yards in a loss to the Rams in September. But Bernard suffered a knee injury in that game, and that was the story of his season as he played in only 12 regular-season games. He suffered an MCL injury in a win over the Bills in December and was placed on injured reserve. The Bucs are willing to give Bernard another chance, signing him to a one-year contract. Bernard essentially signed for the veteran minimum of $1.12 million with a $152,000 signing bonus. Bernard, 30, gives the Bucs three of their four running backs from 2021, including Leonard Fournette and Ke’Shawn Vaughn. They lost Ronald Jones to the Chiefs in free agency. Injuries and the emergence of Fournette as a three-down back limited Bernard to eight carries for 58 yards and 23 catches for 123 yards and 3 touchdowns in 2021. Bernard is the 10th free agent to re-sign with the Bucs from this class. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
