The Rays needed some reinforcements for their bullpen after Tuesday’s marathon win and addressed that need by calling up Dusten Knight. The 31-year-old right-hander was first added to the 40-man roster, then promoted. Ralph Garza Jr., who worked three innings Tuesday in his Rays debut, was sent down. To make room for Knight on the 40-man roster, starter Luis Patino was shifted from the 10- to the 60-day injured list, meaning the soonest he will be able to return from his left oblique strain is early June. Knight is known for doing backflips on the field after recording a save in the minors. He made his big-league debut last year with the Orioles, pitching in nine games, including two against the Rays, but has not had a save. Knight said he has permission from the Rays to do the flip if he gets a save, but wasn’t sure if he would. Cash said if Knight gets the save, he will do a flip. Tommy Romero, who had a rough starting debut on Monday, throwing 59 pitches to get five outs, is sticking around for now, and could get another start or pitch behind an opener. Tonight’s game is a matchup of opening-day starters, Shane McClanahan for the Rays and Frankie Montas for the A’s. Manager Kevin Cash said the move to the 60-day injured list will give Patino time to get built back up as a starter.
