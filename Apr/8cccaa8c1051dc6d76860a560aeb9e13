Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson made history Thursday as the first Black woman confirmed by the U.S. Senate as an associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. Three Republicans joined Senate Democrats and Vermont Independent Bernie Sanders to elevate the 51 year-old federal appeals court judge to the nation’s highest court. “This is a wonderful day, a joyous day, an inspiring day — for the Senate, for the Supreme Court and for the United States of America,” declared Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. While Jackson’s confirmation is historic, the new justice won’t — at least in the short term — change the calculus of the court’s 6-3 conservative majority. Jackson will take her seat when Justice Stephen Breyer retires this summer, replacing him on the court’s liberal wing. Still, Jackson’s personal and professional experiences — her parents’ struggle through racial segregation, her work as a public defender — will bring a fresh and much-needed perspective to the court. And once sworn in, Jackson will be the court’s second youngest member, reflecting the many years of service ahead she has to leave her mark. Even for our young nation, a new first doesn’t come along every day. Jackson will make the court look more like America and help create “the more perfect union” the Constitution envisions. Over time, she can also help the court protect the very diversity that’s essential to preserving the democratic ideal. Editorials are the institutional voice of the Tampa Bay Times.
