The westbound lanes of Interstate 375 in St. Petersburg have re-opened after they were closed for a time this afternoon because of standing water, the Florida Highway Patrol announced on Twitter. A cold front brought heavy rain and storms to the Tampa Bay area today. Cooler, drier air is moving in behind the front. FHP erroneously first reported that it was the eastbound lanes that were closed, but later clarified that it was the westbound lanes.
