Tampa Bay’s alternative rock station is making some changes. WSUN-97.1 FM, better known as 97X, is on the move, but not far. Starting Wednesday at noon, 97X listeners in Pinellas will need to tune into 97.5 FM. For listeners elsewhere, the station will be broadcast on 101.5 HD2 and 94.9 HD2. Both require radios equipped with HD tuners. Online streaming for 97X remains available via the iHeart Radio app, Alexa, 97xonline.com and the 97X smartphone app. The news comes several months after the station changed hands. In February, parent company Cox Media Group made a deal with private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Two of its stations, WSUN 97.1 FM and Orlando pop station WPYO 95.3 FM, were acquired by Spanish Broadcasting System as part of the arrangement, which was worth $12.5 million. While the ways to listen are changing, 97X promised that live music isn’t going anywhere. “97X events, shows, and concerts WILL continue,” the station posted on Facebook. “So don’t stress that one.”
