TAMPA — Two people were struck by lightning in the parking lot of Raymond James Stadium on Saturday after leaving a New York Yankees spring training game at George M. Steinbrenner Field, according to Tampa police. A man in his 60s and a woman in her 20s were injured. Tampa Police said they were struck in parking Lot 1 at Raymond James at about 3:45 p.m. Tampa Fire Rescue paramedics treated both and took them to the hospital. Both were reported to be in stable condition, police said. Raymond James serves as a parking lot for Steinbrenner Field, where the Yankees were playing the Atlanta Braves in a spring training game. The Tampa Bay area is at a marginal risk for severe thunderstorms Saturday. Wind gusts of over 40 miles per hour were recorded from Pinellas County northward. Radar estimates show 2 to 3 inches in some areas from Pasco County through Citrus County, including Sumter County. There is a chance of moderate-sized hail of 1 to 2 inches, the size of Ping Pong balls, until 8 or 9 p.m.
