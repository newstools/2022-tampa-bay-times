A 65-year-old woman drove into a house in New Port Richey on Saturday morning, the Florida Highway Patrol reported. The New Port Richey woman started driving a 2004 Chevy Avalanche backward out of a driveway on Willits Avenue but pressed the gas pedal instead of the brake, the highway patrol said. She drove across the street and crashed into a house. Images provided by the highway patrol show a crushed mailbox and part of the wall torn through where the pickup entered the house. The home wasn’t occupied at the time and there were no reported injuries.
