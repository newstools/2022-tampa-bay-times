Former USF nose tackle Deadrin Senat, one of the strongest players in Bulls football history, has signed a one-year deal with the Bucs. Terms of the contract weren’t immediately available. A third-round pick by the Falcons in 2018, Senat, 27, appeared in only 22 games during an injury-besieged four-season tenure in Atlanta, managing 34 tackles, four quarterback hits and no sacks. He was waived last November. He was far more productive as a Bull, earning first-team All-American Athletic Conference honors after a monstrous senior year in 2017 (66 tackles, 10.5 tackles for loss, six sacks). He was named second-team All-AAC and the Bulls’ defensive MVP as a junior with 49 tackles, including seven for loss. Equally astounding in the weight room, Senat — raised by a handful of surrogates in rural southwest Florida — boasted a 675-pound squat and flirted with 500 pounds on the bench press. Senat could provide depth behind Pro Bowl nose tackle Vita Vea in Todd Bowles’ 3-4 scheme. The team still has Rakeem Nunez-Roches but isn’t expected to re-sign 36-year-old Steve McLendon. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
