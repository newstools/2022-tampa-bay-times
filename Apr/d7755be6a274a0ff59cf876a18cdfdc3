You may need a sweater this weekend, but before that, make sure to grab a raincoat for a soggy Thursday. A late-season cold front may bring severe weather to the Tampa Bay area Thursday morning, according to Tyler Fleming, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Ruskin. The rain could begin as early as sunrise and linger as late as 8 p.m., he said, but the highest chances of severe weather are between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Thursday. Thunderstorms, damaging gusts of wind, small hail and an isolated tornado or waterspout are all possible, Fleming said. Wind gusts could reach up to 40 to 50 mph. After the storm passes, the Tampa Bay area can expect cooler and drier air through the weekend. The morning lows could range from the upper 40s inland to around the 50s on the coast, he said, with highs in the 70s from Friday to Sunday. The cold front passing through Thursday morning is on the later end of the season, Fleming said. Typically, the Tampa Bay area’s most severe weather, outside of hurricane season, occurs during winter cold fronts when colder air clashes with warmer air. “Usually late April through May we get into one of our more drier patterns, where thunderstorms become more rare,” Fleming said. “Then our rainy season starts — generally, throughout like the first week of June.” That first week of June is when the warmer weather will give way to afternoon thunderstorms — and when Hurricane season begins. This week, AccuWeather released its annual hurricane season forecast, predicting conditions are favorable for an active hurricane season. As of Wednesday night, no watches or warnings are in effect for Thursday morning, however, Fleming advises readers to keep an eye out for any weather alerts. “For a day like tomorrow, keep an eye on the weather,” Fleming said. “Beware of any watches or warnings that may be in your area that you might need to take cover for.”
