While many kids will spend the weekend decorating and hunting for eggs ahead of Easter on Sunday, adults can get in on a more mature version of that activity. Beer brand Pabst Blue Ribbon is hiding decorated beer kegs around Tampa on Saturday. The event, done in partnership with “creative lab” Callen, is dubbed the Easter Kegg Hunt. People can find clues on Pabst Blue Ribbon’s social media pages three hours prior to the hunt, which runs from 1 to 4 p.m. The hunt is also happening in Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Wis., and Portland, Ore. In some cities, only one keg will be hidden, while there will be multiples in others. Event organizers didn’t say how many are coming to Tampa. The kegs are full-sized, and if you find one, it’s yours to keep. You also get a gift card for another keg of Pabst Blue Ribbon. Should two people find the same keg at the same time, there will be a trivia contest as a tie-breaker.
