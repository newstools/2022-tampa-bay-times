UPDATE, 6:50 p.m.: CHICAGO — Shortstop Wander Franco, one of the Rays’ top players, was scratched from the lineup about an hour before game time. The Rays said Franco was sidelined due to right quad tightness. He has started all 10 games this season, though he did get somewhat of a rest Saturday when he was the DH. Franco is hitting .318 with no homers and five RBIs. Taylor Walls, who was in the lineup at third base, shifted to shortstop, with Yandy Diaz, who was to be off, now starting at third. Here is the new lineup for the Rays: B. Lowe 2B J. Lowe DH Arozarena LF Choi 1B Diaz 3B Kiermaier CF Zunino C Phillips RF Walls SS McClanahan P 5:12 p.m. CHICAGO — The Rays made their way to historic Wrigley Field, where they are set to take on the Cubs at 7:40 p.m. Shane McClanahan will be on the mound for the Rays, and says he won’t be bothered by the cold weather, with temperatures expected to be in the 30s during the game. “I’ve got a job to do,” McClanahan said. “And it could be 90 degrees outside. It could be 20 degrees outside. Either way, I’m going to try to get the job done.” There will be a lot of talk this series about the Kiermaier brothers: Kevin, the centerfielder for the Rays, and Dan, the head groundskeeper for the Cubs. This is just the Rays’ fourth trip to Wrigley in their 25 seasons, and the first games inside the friendly confines for about half the current team.
