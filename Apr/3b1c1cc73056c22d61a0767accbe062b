A dog and a beer Hot dogs are the only true food at a Tampa Bay Rays game | Column, April 17 I applaud Stephanie Hayes’ support for the time-tested ballgame favorite hot dog. While certainly not the healthiest bite, it has earned its place as an American tradition. As long as I live, I will have to have a dog (with mustard, please!) and a beer at every game I attend. But, a footlong tater “tot” drowning in cheese, bacon and sour cream? Any new Tampa Bay Rays’ stadium will need to consider wider seats. Rick Sherin, Tampa It’s the Legislature’s job Session About 1 Map | April 18 The Florida Legislature is shirking its responsibility to draw new congressional maps during redistricting. We are supposed to have three branches of government. The legislative branch is giving its power to the governor — the executive branch. How is this democratic? Jeanie McKnight, Palm Harbor Horrifying, not surprising The story of one body | April 17 I find people’s shock and surprise at the atrocities being exposed in Ukraine confusing. The only part about this that surprises me is that people are surprised. This is yet another example of textbook Russian Warfare 101. People are right to be appalled and horrified by the news coming out of this conflict ,but If you look at history you will see this is how Russia wages war. They are truly crimes against humanity. Sam Jordan, St. Petersburg Critical thinking Florida targets school math textbooks over critical race theory | April 16 Once again, I am baffled by the bullheadedly myopic focus of Florida’s governor and his sycophants. How on earth does “critical race” factor into mathematics? Why not just ban education altogether and let ignorance become the norm? That way our elected “leaders” could ensure that no one has the audacity to question their blatantly misguided efforts to manipulate a vital educational initiative. Burning or banning books doesn’t solve problems; intelligent thinking does. Kirk Hazlett, Riverview
