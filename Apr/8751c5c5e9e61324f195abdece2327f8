Mark your calendars, Tampa Bay. The week of April 18, the Tampa Bay Times is launching Tampa Times, our newest local email newsletter. As its name suggests, the newsletter will bring a roundup of Tampa community news and events — anchored by veteran City Hall reporter Charlie Frago — straight to your inbox. It’s designed to keep you updated on the biggest developments in our metro area’s largest city and how they affect you. What’s happening in Tampa politics and business? Education? How about real estate and the arts? Tampa Times will feature stories on those topics and more twice a week, for free. More than 1,000 readers have already subscribed to Tampa Times. To join them and get the inaugural edition, sign up here or enter your email address in the form below.
