The start time for the Rays’ game against the Cubs tonight in Chicago has been moved up to 6:30 (Tampa Bay time) due to concerns about the weather. The game was to start at 7:40, but the Cubs made the change due to a “forecast for inclement weather.” Per weather.com, there will be heavy rains in the afternoon and then again around 9, with temperatures around 50 degrees and winds in the 20-30 mph range, with stronger gusts possible. Not that it will be much better starting 70 minutes earlier, but the rain chances are lower. Drew Rasmussen is slated to start for the Rays, who hung on for a 6-5 win on Tuesday, sparked by the return of shortstop Wander Franco. The Cubs are scheduled to start veteran free-agent addition Marcus Stroman. Bally Sports Sun’s pregame coverage will now start at 6. Since this is the Rays’ only scheduled trip to Chicago, league officials likely will want to try to get the game in even if there is a delay. If it is postponed, the Rays would have to return later in the season on a previously scheduled off day. • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
