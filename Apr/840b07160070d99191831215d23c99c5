Old Dominion will support Kenny Chesney for his Here and Now Tour Saturday at Raymond James Stadium. But on Thursday, the roles were reversed at a surprise show. Old Dominion announced the pop-up performance at Ybor City’s Crowbar just three days prior to the event, 99.5 QYK reported. They performed an intimate set for about 300 fans. Mid-way through, Kenny Chesney showed up. According to the radio station, Chesney joined the band on stage to perform his song Save It For A Rainy Day. Several members of Old Dominion helped write the song. “Surprise show indeed! What a crazy fun night in Tampa!” Old Dominion posted on Instagram.
