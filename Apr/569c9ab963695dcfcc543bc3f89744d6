The Florida Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously rejected an appeal from a death row inmate convicted in the 1988 murder of a man in Hillsborough County. Justices refused to order a lower court to hold an evidentiary hearing for Terance Valentine, now 73, who argued that new evidence emerged because of a witness’ affidavit. Valentine was convicted in the killing of Ferdinand Porche, with the Supreme Court opinion saying Valentine “brutally tortured and murdered” the victim. The opinion said Porche was initially shot in the back, paralyzing him from the waist down, then was beaten, stabbed and bound with baling wire. He was then taken to a remote area and fatally shot in the head. A woman who had been married to Valentine also was shot but survived and was a witness against him, according to court documents.
