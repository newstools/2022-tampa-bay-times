PINELLAS PARK — A 60-year-old woman died early Saturday morning after losing control of her motorcycle. Florida Highway Patrol said the Kenneth City woman was riding eastbound on 54th Avenue North, in the right lane, approaching 31st Street North. Around 2:07 a.m., she lost control of her motorcycle for an unknown reason, police say, and the motorcycle collided with a curb west of 31st Street North. The woman flew off the motorcycle and landed in the eastbound travel lanes. She was struck on the roadway by a sedan driven by a 24-year-old from Bradenton. The sedan stopped after hitting the motorcycle rider, who died from her injuries. Florida Highway Patrol did not release any names, but said the woman’s next of kin was notified.
