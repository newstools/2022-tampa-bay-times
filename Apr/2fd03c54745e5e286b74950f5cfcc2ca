A hit-and-run crash early Saturday morning on the Howard Frankland Bridge closed all southbound lanes of I-275 and left a Tampa man injured, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. Saturday at 5:20 a.m. a person driving a Mercedes sedan was traveling south on I-275, near Milepost 35, in the outside lane. Another person was driving parallel in the center lane in a Nissan Pathfinder, trailering a boat. For an unspecified reason, the driver of the sedan lost control of the vehicle and went to the outside shoulder of the road, eventually colliding with a barrier wall, according to troopers. The sedan made its way back onto the road, but then crashed into the trailer towed by the Pathfinder. As a result, the pathfinder jackknifed into the inside lanes of the Howard Frankland Bridge, troopers said, while the boat separated from the trailer and came to a stop. After the crash, the sedan stopped in the travel lanes of I-275. Four unidentified people in the sedan fled the crash on foot, according to troopers. A 36-year-old Tampa man had minor injuries from the crash, which closed all southbound lanes of I-275 until 7:40 a.m., troopers said. Anyone with information about the crash is asked to call the Highway Patrol. This is a developing story. Stay with tampabay.com for updates.
