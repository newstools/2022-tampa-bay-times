CLEARWATER — A fire broke out at the MÜV Medical Cannabis Dispensary off U.S. 19 on Thursday afternoon, disrupting traffic on the highway and prompting at least a dozen firefighters to the building. A photo released by Clearwater Fire & Rescue just after noon showed smoke lingering as firefighters worked to extinguish the fire. It also said the northbound lanes of U.S. 19 were impacted at 197th Avenue N. Fire officials did not release information about the cause of the fire or the extent of damage it caused. Authorities did not say if anyone was inside the building when the fire broke out or if any injuries were sustained. The dispensary shares a building with the New York Diamond Center, which is open on weekdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. A call to the business went unanswered Thursday. A Google page for the dispensary says it has been temporarily closed. The page did not list a reason for the closure or the date it shut its doors.
