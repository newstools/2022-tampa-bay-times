ST. PETERSBURG — The Rowdies dropped their first match of the season Saturday night, 1-0 to Miami at Al Lang Stadium. Tampa Bay (2-1-3) outshot Miami 15-7, but Pierre Da Silva’s goal in the 51st minute stood as the only one of the match. Rowdies acting head coach Jonathan Stead said one of Tampa Bay’s issues was having only two shots on target among the 15. “Those numbers aren’t going to give you results,” he said. “We didn’t really have any cutting edge or show our teeth in front of (the) goal.” On Da Silva’s goal, Miami attacker Joshua Perez first forced Rowdies goalkeeper CJ Cochran into a diving save with a curling shot from 20 yards out. The Rowdies were slow to react to the rebound, allowing Da Silva to clean up with a shot past Cochran. “We were unlucky on that goal,” Rowdies center back Aaron Guillen said. “It’s part of the game. We just need to look ourselves in the mirror and come in Monday to get to work so we can get better at the stuff we (see on) video when we look back.” Rowdies head coach Neill Collins missed the game to travel to Scotland to continue his UEFA Pro License course.
