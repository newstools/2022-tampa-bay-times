Democratic Hillsborough County Commissioner Harry Cohen announced raising more than $68,000 for his re-election in March, calling it the biggest political fundraising month of his career. A former Tampa City Council member and unsuccessful 2019 mayoral candidate, Cohen has raised $108,613 total and said that’s because he’s been out working in the community. “I think I’m doing a good job,” he said. But his Republican opponent, Scott Levinson, said he expected Cohen to out-raise him and that he’ll fight back with a grass roots campaign. “I expect him to raise a lot of money,” Levinson said. “He’s dealing with the elites and I’m dealing with streets, doing retail politics.” Levinson has raised $11,540 but noted that’s far more than he had at this point in the 2020 race. Cohen then raised 10 times as much, $218,128, but Levinson came within two percentage points of winning. However, Levinson faces another problem he didn’t have in 2020. The new political boundary map adopted by commissioners makes Cohen’s South Tampa-based District 1 significantly more Democratic, removing GOP-voting areas of Apollo Beach, Ruskin, Odessa and Keystone, and adding areas including Seminole Heights.
