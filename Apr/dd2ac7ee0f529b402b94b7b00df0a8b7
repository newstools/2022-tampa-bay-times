TAMPA — As one of the league’s top two-way forwards, Anthony Cirelli plays many roles for the Lightning. From goal scorer to puck hound to penalty killer and shot blocker, he wears several hats. Add resident Easter Bunny to that list. As Lightning defenseman Ryan McDonagh hosted his teammates and their families for an Easter Sunday get-together, Cirelli did his part to make the day memorable by donning an Easter Bunny costume for the kids in attendance. Teammates Pat Maroon and Alex KIllorn posted videos of Cirelli in action, with Cirelli at times struggling to keep his rabbit head on with his long hair flowing out the back. “He was really good,” Maroon said with a smile when asked Monday. “Cirelli was a huge, huge hit at the Easter party. Hats off to him. He didn’t have to do that. It’s 100 degrees outside and he’s probably leaking in that suit. He was a great sport and all the kids loved it.” Interestingly enough, Cirelli’s sparkling Easter Bunny performance came a few weeks after he was picked by his teammates as the player who would make the worst babysitter on the team. The Easter party was another example of the off-ice bond Lightning players have. They’ve spent many a holiday together, including earlier this season when Zach Bogosian hosted Thanksgiving dinner. “Just some team bonding,” forward Ross Colton said. “A little bit of time away from the rink is always good to just hang out with the wives and kids, and trying to just get our minds away from the game a little bit is always a good thing.” • • • The Tampa Bay Times has commemorated the Lightning’s second consecutive Stanley Cup title with a new hardcover coffee table book, Striking Twice.
