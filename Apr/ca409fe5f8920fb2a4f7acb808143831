She just keeps it pushing like aye, aye, aye. Lizzo, the Grammy Award-winning R&B artist, rapper, classically trained flautist, actor and body positivity advocate, will bring the Special tour to Tampa’s Amalie Arena on Sept. 24 with a special guest, Atlanta-based rapper Latto. The tour is produced by Live Nation. The tour is in support of her upcoming album, Special, due to be released July 15. Her new single, About Damn Time, recently dropped and the video already has more than 16 million views on YouTube. While the artist born Melissa Jefferson has been on the scene for years, she catapulted into fame in 2019, with her album Cuz I Love You. Her 2019 concert was moved from St. Petersburg’s Jannus Landing to Tampa’s Yuengling Center because of high demand for tickets. The sold-out show was her first arena concert. Lizzo recently hosted and was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live. She quipped when she introduced herself, “Ladies and gentleman, me.” Her reality show, Lizzo’s Watch Out For The Big Grrrls, is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video, where it’s ranked No. 1 in the reality category. She has collaborated with athletic apparel brand Fabletics to launch her shapewear brand, YITTY. The shapewear ranges sizes XS-6X. Ticket prices range $39.50-$129.50 and go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday at ticketmaster.com.
