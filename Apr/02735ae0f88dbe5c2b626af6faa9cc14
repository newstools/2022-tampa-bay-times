Maple Leafs forwards Wayne Simmonds and Kyle Clifford were fined by the league Friday for actions in the game against the Lightning on Thursday. Simmonds was fined $2,250, the maximum allowed under the collective bargaining agreement, for charging defenseman Mikhail Sergachev in the third period of the Lightning’s 8-1 win at Amalie Arena. Clifford was fined $2,500 for high-sticking forward Corey Perry during the third period. Clifford was assessed a match penalty in the game. The teams combined for 30 penalties and 114 penalty minutes, including nine roughing penalties, five misconduct penalties and a pair of fighting majors. Simmonds was given a fighting major late in the second period after a scrap with Lightning forward Pat Maroon, who also got a fighting major. The two also got misconduct penalties in the third. • • • The Tampa Bay Times has commemorated the Lightning’s second consecutive Stanley Cup title with a new hardcover coffee table book, Striking Twice.
