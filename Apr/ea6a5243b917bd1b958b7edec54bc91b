USF second-year guard Caleb Murphy, the team’s leading scorer and the program’s highest-rated signee of the Rivals era, has entered the NCAA transfer portal, according to various reports. Murphy didn’t immediately respond to a text message Monday. The second member of the 2021-22 team to enter the portal, Murphy’s decision could have significant repercussions for a program in dire need of roster stability following an 8-23 season. The 55th-ranked player in the Rivals Class of 2020 national rankings at the time of his signing in November 2019, Murphy was named to the American Athletic Conference all-freshman team two seasons ago before asserting himself as a perimeter cornerstone this season. His 11.4 points, 3.4 assists and 31.8 minutes per game all led the Bulls. He joins reserve forward Jalyn McCreary (5.1 ppg. 3.0 rpg) in the portal. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
