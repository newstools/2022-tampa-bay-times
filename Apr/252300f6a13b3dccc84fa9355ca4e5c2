We write as a group of more than 300 Florida health care professionals who care for transgender and gender diverse youth. We have one common goal: to provide the best quality, evidence-based, individualized and compassionate care for our patients. Ultimately, we strive to empower each patient to achieve their optimal physical, mental, emotional and social health, and we want each person to feel that they are accepted and valued for who they are. The recent statement issued by the Florida Department of Health entitled “Treatment of Gender Dysphoria for Children and Adolescents” misrepresents the weight of the evidence, does not allow for personalized patient and family-centered care, and would, if followed, lead to higher rates of youth depression and suicidality. The Florida Department of Health guidance categorically recommends against social and medical gender transition for any patient under the age of 18. This directly contradicts existing guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Endocrine Society, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. These national and international guidelines are the result of careful deliberation and examination of the evidence by experts including pediatricians, endocrinologists, psychologists and psychiatrists. While we agree with the Florida Department of Health that guidance surrounding care of transgender youth “requires a full, diligent understanding of the scientific evidence,” their statement fails to follow their own recommendations. Specifically, the Florida Department of Health cites a selective and non-representative sample of small studies and reviews, editorials, opinion pieces and commentary to support several of their substantial claims. When citing high-quality studies, they make conclusions that are not supported by the authors of the articles. And while they state that their guidance is consistent with recommendations from Sweden, Finland, the United Kingdom and France, in fact, none of these countries recommends against social gender transition, and all provide a path forward for patients in need of medical intervention. This stands in marked contrast to the categorical ban recommended by the Florida Department of Health. Current national guidelines recommend developmentally appropriate, patient- and family-centered, and nuanced care that promotes children and adolescents’ self-worth. Evaluation and treatment includes thorough assessment by multidisciplinary teams including mental health professionals and medical providers and may include social or medical transition if indicated and desired by the patient and family. Transgender youth face rates of depression that are 5 to 7 times higher and rates of suicidality that are 10 to 20 times higher than that of the cisgender population. Social gender transition and family support are linked to reduced rates of depression and suicidality in these youth. There is little cost and much to gain in supporting a child or adolescent to express themselves fully and honestly. Professional guidelines do not recommend initiation of puberty blocking medications prior to the onset of puberty, and their use has been linked to reduced rates of depression and suicidality. Similarly, guidelines recommend initiation of gender-affirming hormonal treatment only after multidisciplinary teams have confirmed the presence of gender dysphoria and the desire of the patient and parents to start treatment. In addition, the patient must have the mental maturity to weight risks and benefits so as to provide informed consent alongside their guardians, which is present in most by age 16. Treatment is linked to improved body satisfaction and rates of depression. Genital surgeries are not recommended for patients under 18, and masculinizing chest surgeries only after patients meet strict criteria and can give truly informed consent alongside their guardians. In all cases, these decisions are made with great thoughtfulness and cannot be dealt with in a one-size-fits-all approach. While we need research to further improve care for transgender and gender diverse youth, taking away social support and medical care is not the answer. We urge the professionals at the Florida Department of Health to reconsider its guidance in favor of a more individualized, patient- and family-centered, and compassionate approach.
