Florida Gators quarterback Anthony Richardson was stopped for driving 105 mph shortly after 4 a.m. last week, according to a citation from the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office. Richardson was pulled over at 4:11 a.m. on Monday, April 4 on Newberry Road in unincorporated Alachua County, about 13 miles west of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. Richardson, who has a name, image and likeness deal with Gainesville Dodge, was driving a 2021 Dodge at the time. Law enforcement said he was going “in excess” of 105 mph, according to the citation. Because that’s more than 30 mph over the speed limit (60), he faces a mandatory court hearing. Arraignment is scheduled for May 25, according to court records. Richardson, who turns 20 next month, is the top talent on the team and one of the most high-profile players in the state. The former four-star recruit from Gainesville’s Eastside High was part of the SEC’s all-freshman team last season. In eight games (one start), he rushed for 401 yards and three touchdowns and threw for 529 yards and six scores. He continued to improve this spring after recovering from a knee injury. In Thursday night’s spring game, Richardson was unofficially 18-of-25 for 207 yards and two touchdowns. UF’s presumptive starter also rushed for a score and drew praise from first-year coach Billy Napier for his “first-class” approach. “When I think about a quarterback, we think about a person who represents everything of what the organization is about,” Napier said afterward. “Certainly at the highest level of football, the quarterback is the face of the organization They set the greatest example with their work ethic, their attention to detail, their self-discipline, their approach.” • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
