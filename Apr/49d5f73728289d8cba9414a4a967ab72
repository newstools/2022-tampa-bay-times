The St. Pete Pier has canceled Saturday’s Cinco de Mayo-themed party “due to expected weather,” organizers announced Friday. Forecasters expect showers and thunderstorms starting Saturday afternoon in the Tampa Bay area. The event, called Fiesta: A Cinco de Mayo Party, was to have been held at Spa Beach on the Pier approach on Saturday from 1 to 9 p.m. Tickets were $10-$20 and VIP $55-$75. Organizers said full refunds will be issued for this event, and consumers will be reached shortly. “On behalf of the Pier, we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause,” said a statement issued from spokesperson Katrina Archuleta. “However, the safety of our attendees, event crew and performers is top priority.”
