LARGO — He saved Astoria from being steamrolled by evil developers and all of Middle-earth from Sauron. Now, actor Sean Astin is in Tampa Bay to help a group of teen detectives bring down an organized pet theft scheme for the movie Pet Detective, currently being filmed in Largo. The Goonies and Lord of the Rings actor portrays an undercover FBI agent, according to producer David Yates. According to Yates, this is the plot of Pet Detective: “When a string of mysterious pet disappearances occurs in their neighborhood, the loud-mouthed and rebellious Gabe teams up with the strong-willed and straight-shooting Olivia and the nerdy new kid Jayden to investigate the case. “Together, the unlikely group of teen detectives quickly uncover an organized pet theft scheme run by two dim-witted crooks and their evil boss. Will Gabe, Olivia and Jayden be able to bring down the criminals and rescue the pets from a terrible fate?” Yates described the movie as a comedy “as well as a touching telling of the timeless story of friendship and the deep bond between children and their animals.” It is the seventh of a slate of 10 films that Yates hopes to make in the Tampa Bay area. The first was shot in October. The most recent to wrap was The Plus One, starring Cedric the Entertainer and Ashanti. The next movie is planned for May, Yates said.
