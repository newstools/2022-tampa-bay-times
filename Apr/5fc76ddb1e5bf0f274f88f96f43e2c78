Only two weeks from Thursday, commissioner Roger Goodell will stroll to a podium on a sleek stage, setting off a chorus of boos sure to resonate across the Las Vegas strip. The NFL draft, a tradition like no other, is looming. The combines and pro days mostly have concluded, but teams will keep conducting formal interviews and gathering assorted intelligence right up until the first round’s commencement the night of April 28. While zero consensus exists on whom the Bucs are targeting with the 27th overall pick, we’ve narrowed our own guesswork. Based on the team’s positional needs, workout data, some of the more reputable mock drafts and Tom Brady’s influence (we expect he’ll have some pull in the war room), we project the team’s first-round pick to come from this list of eight prospects. Here they are, in alphabetical order: Treylon Burks, receiver, Arkansas Size: 6-2/225 Notable workout stat: Ran 40-yard dash in 4.55 seconds at NFL scouting combine Notable player stats: 66 catches, 1,104 yards, 16.7 yards per catch in 2021 The Bucs aren’t about to be caught with minimal receiver depth a second year in a row. In this target-heavy draft, Burks — Arkansas’ top receiver each of the last three years — still could be available at No. 27. His game tape (eight catches for 179 yards and two touchdowns vs. Alabama last fall) consistently trumps his middling combine numbers. As a high school sophomore, Burks caught 11 passes (including three TDs) while playing with a cast on his right hand. Kyler Gordon, cornerback, Washington Size: 5-11½/194 Notable workout stat: Has recorded a 42.5-inch vertical jump (according to The Athletic) Notable player stats: Allowed 21 catches on 41 targets for 243 yards and no touchdowns in 2021 While we expect the Bucs to use their first pick on someone who can catch or block for Tom Brady, a corner wouldn’t surprise us, considering Sean Murphy-Bunting and Jamel Dean are entering the final year of their rookie contracts. Gordon danced competitively (all styles) around the world as a teen and also practices Kung Fu, explaining his freakish flexibility. Kenyon Green, offensive guard, Texas A&M Size: 6-4/323 Notable workout stat: Ran 40-yard dash in 5.24 seconds at NFL scouting combine Notable player stat: Started at every offensive line position except center in 2021 While the Bucs possess some viable candidates (Aaron Stinnie, Robert Hainsey) for the guard spot opposite recently acquired veteran Shaq Mason, they may not be able to resist this 2021 first-team All-American with the 34⅛-inch arms. Green, who started 35 college games, allowed two pressures last season on 194 pass blocks at left guard, according to ESPN’s Mel Kiper. Zion Johnson, guard/center, Boston College Size: 6-3/312 Notable workout stat: 32 bench-press reps of 225 pounds at NFL scouting combine Notable player stats: Allowed no quarterback pressures in 2021 and one sack in 2,288 snaps at Boston College, according to ESPN’s advanced stats Another tantalizing guard option, should the Bucs opt to use their first pick to help protect Brady. Johnson ran a 5.18-second 40-yard dash at the combine and shined at center at the Senior Bowl but has generational-guard potential. He graded out as the seventh-best guard nationally (83.4) in 2021, according to Pro Football Focus. Trey McBride, tight end, Colorado State Size: 6-4/246 Notable workout stat: 18 bench-press reps of 225 pounds at NFL scouting combine Notable player stat: Ranked ninth in Division I-A with school-record 90 catches last season Even if Rob Gronkowski returns in 2022, the Bucs will remain thin at tight end with Cameron Brate the only other guy at this spot under contract. McBride, the 2021 Mackey Award winner, has Baby Gronk written all over him. Complementing his ball skills and strength is a robust passion for blocking. Sound familiar? David Ojabo, edge rusher, Michigan Size: 6-4/250 Notable workout stat: Ran 40-yard dash in 4.55 seconds at NFL scouting combine Notable player stats: 11 sacks, school-record five forced fumbles (tied for third in Division I-A) in 2021 In a conventional year, Ojabo — whom some say possesses greater pro potential than Wolverines teammate Aidan Hutchinson — could represent a steal for the Bucs. Because he suffered a torn Achilles during Michigan’s pro day in mid-March, he’s likely to be available at No. 27. Problem is, the Bucs are in win-now mode with a 45-year-old quarterback and may not be inclined to spend a first-round pick on a guy who might not be at full strength until 2023. Christian Watson, receiver, North Dakota State Size: 6-4/208 Notable workout stat: Ran 40-yard dash in 4.36 seconds at NFL scouting combine Notable player stat: Averaged 20.4 yards per catch on 105 career receptions at NDSU Word is, Bucs coaches are enamored with this late bloomer, who earned a max-99 athleticism score with his combine performance, according to NFL Next Gen stats. A Plant High alumnus whose physical development came late in the recruiting process, Watson totaled 57 plays (rushing, receiving, returning) that went for 20 or more yards in college. A physical replicate of Mike Evans with local ties? Yeah, that might play well with the fan base. Devonte Wyatt, defensive tackle, Georgia Size: 6-3/304 Notable workout stat: Ran 40-yard dash in 4.77 seconds at NFL scouting combine Notable player stats: 39 tackles, 2.5 sacks, two forced fumbles in 2021 The breakout star of a 2021 Georgia defense that could evolve from formidable to fabled over time, Wyatt’s 2021 grade from Pro Football Focus (89.8) led all Power Five defensive linemen. He’s projected as a three-technique, which isn’t exactly compatible with Tampa Bay’s 3-4 scheme, but we’re guessing Todd Bowles could maximize Wyatt’s speed and agility. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
