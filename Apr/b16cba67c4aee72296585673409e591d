TAMPA — Portions of two busy South Tampa streets closed while crews repair a water main are expected to reopen Saturday, city officials said. Crews on Thursday closed portions of West Gandy Boulevard and South Himes Avenue to repair a pipeline near the intersection of the two thoroughfares, according to a city news release issued Friday. The pipeline was hit by a third-party contractor who was not doing work for the city, the release said. By Friday morning, workers were starting to repair the roads. The city initially said its goal was to reopen the roads sometime Tuesday, but in an updated news release sent at 6:01 p.m. Friday, the city announced plans to reopen the roads at noon Saturday. All travel lanes on South Himes between West Hawthorne Road and West Marlin Avenue Street are closed. All travel lanes on West Gandy between South Dale Mabry Highway and South Sherwood Avenue also are closed. For live updates, check the city’s web page on transportation advisories and road closures.
