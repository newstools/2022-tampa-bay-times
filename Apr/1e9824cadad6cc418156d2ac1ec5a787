In the space of less than 10 days, Seminole City Councilor Chris Burke has filed for and then withdrawn from the race for state House District 59 in west central Pinellas, the new district covering much of the area now represented by Rep. Nick DiCeglie, R-Indian Rocks Beach. Burke, a Largo police officer, said this week he’s decided he’d rather remain on the City Council, but added that competing in what promises to be a hard-fought Republican primary after filing late would be “definitely an uphill battle.” Other Republicans already running in the GOP-leaning district, which covers parts of Largo, Seminole and Belleair, are former state prosecutor Berny Jacques and business lawyer Jennifer Wilson, both of whom have raised more than $100,000; and physician Dipak Dinanath Nadkarni, who filed in March. Burke said he made his decision after a council retreat focusing on the city’s upcoming capital projects. Also withdrawn from the race, according to DiCeglie, is Alen Tomczak, a National Guard captain who had been endorsed by DiCeglie as his successor. Tomczak himself could not be reached for comment. Tomczak had raised more than $93,000 as of February, but his Guard unit is being deployed, making it impossible for him to serve, backers said.
