Every year on the first Saturday in May, the comic book industry comes together to give away free comics and encourage both seasoned and first-time comic book readers to flock to their local comic shops. It has grown the past 20 years to become the biggest day of the year for the industry, when people end up buying lots of merch after snapping up their share of free comic books. “It’s exciting for people to get free things, but they also find it’s a good time to get other books too,” said Mike Doles, owner of the Comic Spot in Riverview. “My parents got me into reading with comic books, and I use comic books to get my kids into reading, too.” The titles available have a wide range of attractions for both little kids and seasoned comic fans. This year features titles from Disney, Spider-Man, Stranger Things, Doctor Who, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Walking Dead, Sonic the Hedgehog and more. There will be 46 different comic books from DC Comics, Marvel, Dark Horse Comics, IDW Publishing, BOOM! Studios and a slew of independent publishers. Find a complete list of titles at freecomicbookday.com. The idea was first launched in 2002 by Joe Field, owner of a California comic shop, and was an immediate success. In addition to passing out free comics, many comic shops also host costume contests, creator signings and photos with costumed characters. “It’s one of the biggest sales days of the year for comic book stores,” said Scott Rienbeck, owner of Read More Comics in Brandon, the Tampa Bay area’s oldest comic book store. He said the biggest buzz this year is for the free Marvel releases, especially Avengers/X-Men No. 1. It will introduce Bloodline, a new character who is the daughter of Marvel’s Blade, the vampire hunter. “I saw that people are already scalping that free comic on eBay for $5,” Rienbeck said.
