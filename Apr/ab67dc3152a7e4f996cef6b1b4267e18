Hyde Park Village is adding a hotel to its mix of retail and restaurant offerings in South Tampa. Palisociety, a boutique hotel franchise based in Los Angeles, will open Palihouse Hyde Park Village next year at 1509 W Swann Ave., according to a media release. The new hotel in Tampa will be on the second floor above the On Swann restaurant and will be designed similarly to the surrounding historic neighborhood. It’s set to have 36 rooms and the building’s footprint won’t change, according to WS Development, the real estate firm that owns and manages Hyde Park Village. Hyde Park Village has grown significantly during the pandemic, adding a number of new dining and shopping options like Sephora, a Kittenish boutique, quirky scoop shop OddFellows Ice Cream Co. and a Nike Live concept store. The outdoor shopping center announced earlier this week it will open Zimmermann, a luxury Australian fashion boutique. But Hyde Park Village has yet to have a hotel — until now. “The only thing you can’t currently do in Hyde Park Village is spend the night,” said president of WS Development Samantha David in a statement. “And we are excited for that to change.” Palisociety operates hotels in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, and Miami. The hospitality firm described its design style as an “unapologetically eclectic aesthetic” that’s unique to each property and based off the character of its neighborhood. “When we stepped into Hyde Park Village, we immediately understood that we wanted to interpret that feeling into a signature Palisociety hotel experience — one that we can’t wait to introduce to Tampa,” said Palisociety founder Avi Brosh in a statement.
