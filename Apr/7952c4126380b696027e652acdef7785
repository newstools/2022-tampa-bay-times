A cliff diver who went missing and later died on the Hawaiian island of Kauai has been identified as a Pasco County man. Kauai Police said Shane Uzzel, 39, of Hudson was found off the waters of Nawiliwili, on the island’s southeastern coast, at around 6 a.m. Friday. Uzzel had been missing since 3:30 a.m. that morning, when a friend told police that he was cliff diving and was swept out to sea. A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter crew spotted Uzzel’s body about 50 to 60 yards offshore, and a Coast Guard cutter ship pulled him in. The crew administered first aid and attempted to revive Uzzel en route to a Coast Guard station and nearby hospital emergency room. Uzzel was pronounced dead at 7:45 a.m. Friday. Lifeguards and authorities from the Kauai Fire Department also participated in the search-and-rescue operation.
