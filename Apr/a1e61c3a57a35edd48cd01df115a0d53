A Wesley Chapel sports bar and restaurant is opening a second location in downtown Tampa. Top Shelf Sports Lounge, which has a location in the AdventHealth Center Ice Facility, will open a new, 4,674-square-foot location on the ground level of Truist Place at 401 E Jackson Street, building management company Highwoods Properties announced Thursday. Highwoods describes the new Top Shelf as an “upscale sports lounge” with an indoor-outdoor bar and American fare on the menu. Top Shelf owners Joe Boyd and Keelan Cottle envision the new location as an “elevated version” of what’s in Wesley Chapel, Cottle said in a statement. “The Truist building is the perfect location for the fun, fast-paced environment we plan on creating at our restaurant,” Cottle said. The property is now under construction along Jackson Street and is expected to open in 2023.
