ST. PETERSBURG — Brett Phillips returned to the field after the Rays’ win over the Orioles Sunday at Tropicana Field to take photos with a dozen relatives and friends at the game to celebrate his stepfather, David Foushee’s, 63rd birthday. As the group posed, kids circled the bases as part of the Rays’ Family Fun Days activities. Phillips’ older sister, Brittany, asked the 27-year-old Rays outfielder if he wanted to take a trip back in time. The two grew up in Seminole and remember being at one of the then-Devil Rays’ first fan fest events — with the highlight being running the bases at the Trop. “My sister was like, ‘Here we are 20 years later. Want to run the bases with the kids?’” Phillips recounted. “I was like, ‘Heck, yeah, I do.’ That was a nice little memory.” So Phillips, still in full uniform, and Brittany jumped into the line to join the fun. As he neared home plate, Phillips spread his arms into the airplane move he made famous during his mad dash into the outfield after delivering the pinch-hit that led to a 2020 World Series win that was one of the wildest in MLB history. After crossing the plate, Phillips hugged Brittany, high-fived a couple of fan hosts and headed to the dugout. A fan posted a video of the siblings running the bases to Twitter. By Monday afternoon, it had more than 161,000 views. More attention is sure to come. “It’s cool that people are interested, but it’s normal to me,” Phillips said. “When people think it’s the craziest thing ever, I don’t know. I guess it’s really cool.” So, will Phillips now make this a regular thing after Sunday home games? “I may have to,” he said. • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
