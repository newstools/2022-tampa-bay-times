After a two-year absence because of the pandemic, the popular Green Thumb Festival returns to St. Petersburg this weekend, bringing free plant and mulch giveaways, a flower show and activities for kids. The festival has been a tonic for spring fever for nearly 40 years in St. Petersburg. Shoppers pull wagons around to more than 120 vendors selling flowers, trees, garden decor, butterfly attractors, herbs and more at Walter Fuller Park. Bring soil or water samples for diagnostic testing, ask an arborist questions and bring your dull tools for sharpening. There will be more than 2,000 trees for sale for $5, and free butterfly plants and free mulch will be available both Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m.-4 p.m. Inside the Walter Fuller community center, the St. Petersburg Garden Club holds its annual flower show with some stunning displays. There will be arts, crafts and hands-on presentations at the Kids Tent and horticultural and environmental presentations at the Main Tent. A Garden Wagon Parade and Decorating Contest will be held at 11:30 a.m. Saturday. Anyone can enter to deck out their garden wagon for prizes, one for kids and one for adults. Entry fee is $5. Register at stpeteparksrec.org/greenthumb. New this year is a lineup of free workshops for adults taught by master gardeners. Registration is required because space is limited at stpeteparksrec.org/greenthumb.
