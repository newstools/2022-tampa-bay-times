The Rays opted to make today a bullpen day, using an assortment of relievers, in the absence of an available traditional starter or bulk-inning pitcher. In doing so, they pushed veteran Corey Kluber’s next start back to Friday, giving him six days since his last outing. Left-hander Jeffrey Springs, who came back from a knee injury sustained last season, will be the opening reliever for the Rays. Expect to see lefty Jalen Beeks at some point early.
