TAMPA ― Devin White didn’t follow up an incredible Super Bowl run in 2020 with his best performance last season. In fact, it left a lot to be desired. White’s sack totals dropped from 9 to 3-1/2. He had no forced fumbles or interceptions and, at times, was a liability in coverage. Some of that had to do with his additional coverage assignments with all the injuries to the secondary. However, White remains one of the Bucs’ best defensive players. As expected, the team picked up the fifth-year option on his contract Wednesday, ahead of Monday’s deadline. White was the No. 5 overall pick in 2019 NFL draft. In 45 career games, he has 242 tackles (27 for loss), 39 quarterback hits, 15 sacks, 10 passes defensed, six fumble recoveries, four forced fumbles and one interception. He was named to the Pro Bowl in 2021 after leading the Bucs with 128 tackles. White originally signed a four-year contract worth $29,315,814. According to Overthecap.com, he will earn $11.706 million in 2022 due to his playing time over the first three seasons. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
