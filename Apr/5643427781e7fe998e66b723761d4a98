A health and wellness company founded by Tom Brady and Alex Guerrero has a new leader at the helm. Grant Shriver is the new CEO and partner of TB12, according to a media release. Shriver will lead the company’s growth in product development, technology and body coaching. He will continue to build on the company’s proprietary method and research, which developed the first pain-free performance and recovery practices, the release said. Shriver was a vice president of private brands, product development and global operations at Lowe’s Home Improvement prior to joining TB12. He’s also held leadership positions at national retailers and department stores including Kohl’s and At Home. “Grant and I share the three most critical things that I have built my career on – discipline, strategy, and team,” said Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady in a statement. “Alex and I are excited to join forces with him to bring the extraordinary TB12 health and wellness holistic approach to the masses.” TB12 recently announced partnerships with medical facilities like HSS Florida in West Palm Beach and the Vincera Institute in Philadelphia, according to the release. “I’m very honored to join Tom and Alex as CEO and Partner of TB12, bringing my skill set and experience, to a company of such high standards, to lead the only company focused on this one-of-a-kind method built upon the best practices of delivering high performance while living pain-free, all inspired by Tom’s proven longevity in the NFL through his tremendous work with Alex, it is a dream opportunity,” Shriver said in a statement.
