They were won by Bill Colombo, a former Port Richey council member and vice mayor, and Linda Rodriguez, who has been serving as an appointed council member since late last year. The other candidate for the at-large council seat was John Hoover. In Dade City, the winners of the two available seats were incumbent Scott Black in the Group 1 seat and Ann Cosentino in the Group 2 seat.
