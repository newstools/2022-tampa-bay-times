Mitchell High School fell short of its goal of a second national title late last month at the USA Hockey National Championships. The Mustangs, the lone representative from Florida in the High School Division II field after winning their sixth state championship in March, went 1-2 in pool play March 24-26 in Dallas. Mitchell, currently one of 22 varsity programs in the Lightning High School Hockey League (LHSHL), won a national championship in the High School Combined division in 2016 in Reston and Ashburn, Va. Mitchell defeated Bishop Canevin (Pa.), 3-0, in its opening game on March 24. Senior captain Kevin Rosello scored the only even-strength goal of the game. Carter Trussler and Garrett Bagnall added power-play goals. The following day, Mitchell fell to Jackson Hole Moose (Wyo.) 4-2. William Fliss and Bagnall scored the only goals for the Mustangs. Mitchell was shut out 5-0 by Frisco West (Texas) on March 26, eliminating the Mustangs from the tournament. Mitchell was outshot 41-21 and held to just three shots in the second period.
