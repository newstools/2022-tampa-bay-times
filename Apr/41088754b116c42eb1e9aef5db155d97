Another fitness studio is coming to Water Street Tampa. Rukus Cycling Studios will open its first Tampa location at Sparkman Wharf later this year, Strategic Property Partners announced last week. The fitness franchise headquartered in Orlando will offer high-intensity cardio sessions, muscle shaping training and has amenities like cycling shoes, pH-balanced filtered water, lockers, private showers, changing rooms and toiletries for before and after classes. The company has locations around Florida and the Southeast, like Atlanta, Nashville and Charleston. The 2,588-square-foot Tampa studio will be located at 615 Channelside Dr. Members have the option to take heart rate-based classes or use the equipment any time with a library of pre-recorded sessions. Water Street Tampa is booming with new openings this year as the project wraps up its first phase of development. More than 30 retailers have signed leases, according to SPP. The cycling studio will join a slew of other fitness and wellness-oriented brands at Water Street. The development of the project, led by Tampa Bay Lightning’s Jeff Vinik and Bill Gates’ Cascade Investment, aims to create a community centered around healthy living. Publix GreenWise Market, F45 and Bodyrok have already opened with The Covery and Orangetheory Fitness coming later this year. “Water Street Tampa has continued to attract innovative retailers that see Tampa’s promise and want to establish roots in the city’s most forward-thinking new neighborhood,” said Lee Schaffler, Chief Portfolio Officer for SPP, in a statement.
