A Czech data company has picked Tampa for its new U.S. headquarters. Prague-based Manta, founded in 2016, has offices in Dublin, Ireland and Lisbon, Portugal, but picked Tampa due to the growth in recent years of the region’s technology talent pipeline. “The surge of Tampa’s tech scene is a major reason why we decided to build our team in this hub of top talent,” Manta founder and CEO Tomas Kratky said in a statement. “Manta’s commitment to improving data visibility for enterprises of all sizes depends on the talent of its employees. Tampa is the perfect place to continue to build our team of experts who will help drive the company’s growth in the U.S. We plan to continue to grow in the area and expand our presence here.” Manta is a data lineage company, which means it provides services for businesses to organize, track, scan and utilize the voluminous amounts of data that pass through their servers each day. Manta has had a presence in Tampa for a while. The company has grown rapidly since closing a $13 million Series A fundraising round in 2020, with two-thirds of its new hires coming in Tampa. The company has about 40 employees in a WeWork space in downtown Tampa, and is currently hiring for finance, sales and marketing positions. A spokesperson said the company will be looking for permanent offices soon.
