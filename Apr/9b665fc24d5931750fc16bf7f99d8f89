ST. PETERSBURG — Having played 16 games, the Rays are basically 10 percent of the way through their season. That’s still early, and much too small of a sample size, to draw any real conclusions. But it can give us some early ideas about what we’re going to see during the summer and into the fall. In two words, “Buckle up.” These Rays, at 9-7 and a game back in the American League East, look like they’re going to be competitive and able to challenge for a third consecutive division title and fourth straight playoff berth. But it’s not going to be easy. For, every day you marvel at what Wander Franco does next — and there will be a lot — you will mutter over something someone else does wrong. The pitching, especially on days Shane McClanahan starts, will impress you at times and depress you at others as the lack of depth surfaces. And the athleticism that allows the Rays to do so many amazing things in the field and on the bases also will lead to mistakes, as Randy Arozarena has shown repeatedly. Here are 10 numbers that tell some of the Rays’ story so far: .101 Difference in Rays’ team batting average with runners in scoring position (.188, 9-for-48) in their seven losses and in those situations (.289, 28-for-97) in their nine wins 3 Relievers with saves: Andrew Kittredge, Brooks Raley, Ryan Thompson. Expect more. Number of Rays with saves the last three seasons: 14 (MLB record), 12 (previous MLB record), 11 3.43 Team ERA, ranking 14th in the majors, seventh in the AL. In nine games since April 15, it is 2.88, ranking 10th in the majors, seventh in the AL 6 Pitchers hurt since the start of spring training (Shane Baz, JT Chargois, Pete Fairbanks, Chris Mazza, Luis Patino, Ryan Yarbrough), combined with four recovering from 2021 surgeries (Nick Anderson, Yonny Chirinos, Tyler Glasnow, Brendan McKay), making for 10 on the injured list for non-COVID reasons. Overall, the Rays have used a majors-most 22 pitchers already, including eight starters/openers 10 Games, of 16, decided by one or two runs; second-most in majors 11 Outs made on the bases (not counting pickoffs, caught steals or force plays), per baseball-reference.com, most in the majors, including four by Arozarena. The Rays have taken 17 bases (on fly balls, wild pitches, passed balls, balks, defensive indifference), 11th most in majors, and are 9-of-12 on steals 14 Different batting orders used in 16 games, with only one used more than once (with a 1-2 record): Brandon Lowe Wander Franco Randy Arozarena Ji-Man Choi Yandy Diaz Josh Lowe Manuel Margot Kevin Kiermaier Francisco Mejia Number of batting orders used by Rays last three seasons: 158, 59 (in 60-game season), 152 21 Team-high strikeouts, in 52 plate appearances, for rookie outfielder Josh Lowe, to go with a .170 average, zero homers, three RBIs and a .527 OPS. (Austin Meadows, who was traded to Detroit to make room for Lowe, is hitting .333 with no homers, nine RBIs, an .889 OPS and 10 strikeouts). Also off to slow starts: Mike Zunino,  .086 with 0 homers, 1 RBI, 13 strikeouts, .246 OPS; Kevin Kiermaier, .162, 1 homer, 5 RBIs, 14 strikeouts, .541 OPS; Brandon Lowe, .190, 3 homers, 8 RBIs, 14 strikeouts, .646 OPS 22 Hits for Franco in 15 games, second-most in the majors through Sunday, including seven doubles (also second-most) and three homers, for a .349 average (13th) and .999 OPS (11th). He shares the major-league lead with eight multi-hit games. He also leads the AL and is second in the majors with 30 balls hit with an exit velocity of 95 mph or greater and has an average of 91.6 mph (17th in AL, 29th overall) 29.5 Percent of pitches in which Shane McClanahan has used his curveball, up from 16.4 percent last year, mostly in place of his slider, which is down to 16-percent usage from 34.6 percent, per baseballsavant.mlb.com. He has opted for a greater mix, with his fastball usage down (48.9 to 37.3) and changeup up (8 to 16). Through four starts, McClanahan leads the majors with 31 strikeouts and is on a pace over 30 starts for 233 • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
