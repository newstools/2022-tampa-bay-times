TAMPA — An early-morning crash on the Courtney Campbell Causeway early Wednesday killed two men and prompted authorities to close the roadway in both directions Wednesday, Tampa police said. The causeway is expected to remain closed throughout rush hour, police said, shutting down one of three bridges that connect Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. Cameras from Florida 511 show commuters on the Howard Frankland Bridge and Hillsborough Avenue were facing an increase in traffic around 7 a.m. Tampa police say the crash happened on the Clearwater side of the causeway but remained in their jurisdiction. Commuters from Tampa are being detoured at Ben T. Davis Beach while drivers from Clearwater aren’t able to enter the bridge at all. Witnesses called 911 around 3:40 a.m. to report a vehicle flipped and its occupants were ejected, police said. Two men from that vehicle died at the scene, another is in critical condition and a woman was hospitalized with possible internal injuries, according to police. The driver of a second car in the crash was not injured and is cooperating with investigators. Police did not release the cause of the crash or the names of those involved. Police say officers from the Clearwater Police Department also responded to the crash and are helping with traffic control on the Pinellas side of the causeway. This is a developing story.
