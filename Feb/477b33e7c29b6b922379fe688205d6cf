DADE CITY — Trial has entered a third week in the case against retired Tampa police captain Curtis Reeves, charged with second-degree murder for fatally shooting a man eight years ago during a confrontation at a Wesley Chapel movie theater. The defense is presenting its case. Trial highlights Wednesday included testimony from Michael Knox, who formerly worked in law enforcement in Jacksonville and holds advanced degrees in engineering and criminal justice. Knox laid out best practices for crime scene investigation, many of which may not have been followed in the theater shooting. Knox visited the crime scene for the defense and used mannequins to recreate the shooting. Reeves, 71 at the time, argues he fired in self-defense, saying he feared harm from the 43-year-old Oulson, in part because Reeves’ health was deteriorating with age. Prosecutors countered the claim with testimony that Reeves had gone hunting in the days before the fatal shooting. The confrontation began when Reeves noticed Oulson texting during the movie previews and told him to stop. The two argued and Reeves left to complain to a manager. He returned and informed Oulson what he had done. Oulson grabbed Reeves’ popcorn and threw it in his face and Reeves pulled the handgun and fired. The defense has raised questions about whether Oulson threw another object, too, perhaps a cell phone. Staff writer Anastasia Dawson, is reporting live from the trial at the Robert D.
