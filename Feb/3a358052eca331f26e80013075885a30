TAMPA — After more than two dozen residents spoke and as midnight drew near, the Tampa City Council late Thursday denied a land-use change for a Tampa Heights cemetery, preventing a portion of from getting turned into residences. The 6-0 vote came after impassioned arguments from Tampa Heights residents, family members of those buried in the separate and adjacent Woodlawn Cemetery. The matter had been delayed since late September after a developer associated with a proposal to build up to 15 single-family or townhomes on 1.56 acres of the Greater Tampa Showman’s Association-owned cemetery next to Woodlawn pulled out. The Showmen’s Association board continued with its request, hiring a firm that said it didn’t locate any bodies on portion of the cemetery that hadn’t been used for burials. But many opponents remained unpersuaded. Council member John Dingfelder missed the meeting due to minor surgery. The Showmen’s Association bought three acres from the city in 1971 on the 3400 block of N Boulevard to provide final resting places for the area’s circus and carnival workers.
