You might call it “Mayor’s Row.” Three of Tampa’s five living former mayors — Sandy Freedman, Dick Greco and Pam Iorio — all live in condos on Bayshore Boulevard within a couple of blocks of each other. Iorio’s in The Stovall, Greco in Virage two blocks south and Freedman in Bayshore Regency next door to Virage. Not surprising, given the desirable address and any mayor’s wish to be close to the heart of their city. But all three also happen to live on the seventh floors of their buildings, a story raconteur Greco loves to tell. Coincidence? Only partly. Freedman, at least, chose the seventh floor for a very practical reason: That’s the highest the Tampa Fire Department’s ladder trucks can reach in a rescue operation. The trucks can reach 95-105 feet, or the sixth or seventh floors of a typical high-rise, depending on how close they can get to the building, said Tampa Fire Rescue spokesperson Vivian McIlrath. “When I moved in there were three condos available, mine and two higher up,” Freedman said. “I picked mine because the fire department had told me that’s how high they could reach.” Greco said it’s a coincidence that he’s also on the seventh floor; Iorio couldn’t be reached for comment.
