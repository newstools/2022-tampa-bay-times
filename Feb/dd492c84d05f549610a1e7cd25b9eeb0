GADSDEN, Ala. — A hunter in east Alabama found the car driven by an elderly Florida woman missing since 2019 in a wooded area where human remains also were located, authorities said. While police said the 2019 Kia Optima discovered in woods off a road in the Black Creek community belonged to Lorene Virginia Collier, 84, Capt. Josh Morgan of the Etowah County Sheriff’s Office said the remains had not yet been positively identified, WIAT-TV reported. Collier, 84, of Tampa was reported missing in March 2019 while in Alabama to visit her two brothers. She left the home of one brother to visit the other brother but didn’t make it. No foul play was suspected in Collier’s disappearance, Morgan said. Police planned a news conference on Friday to discuss the case.
