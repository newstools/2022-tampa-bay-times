Former USF coach Charlie Strong is returning to the state college ranks. ESPN first reported late Friday evening that Strong, who spent the 2021 season on Urban Meyer’s staff with the Jaguars, is finalizing a deal to coach linebackers at the University of Miami. Strong, 61, didn’t immediately respond to a phone message Saturday morning. He joins a prominent, proven staff being assembled by new Hurricanes coach Mario Cristobal that includes former Michigan offensive coordinator Josh Gattis; and former LSU, Alabama and Clemson defensive coordinator Kevin Steele. While Strong’s state connections span nearly 40 years, he flopped in his last Florida collegiate gig. Inheriting a stacked roster from predecessor Willie Taggart at USF in 2017, the program regressed on his watch, from 10-2 to 7-6 to 4-8 in three seasons. Upon Strong’s firing in December 2019, the Bulls had lost 14 of their last 18 games and the roster essentially was barren. But he mostly flourished during a seven-year run (2003-2009) as Gators defensive coordinator (one of four stints he had at UF), helping lead the program to a pair of national titles during the Meyer tenure. Hired as Louisville head coach in December 2009, Strong lured Miami Northwestern standout Teddy Bridgewater to the Commonwealth, and the Cardinals amassed a 23-3 record in 2012 and 2013, with a Sugar Bowl romp of Florida after the 2012 season. Strong’s other head coaching stop was a mediocre three-year run (16-21) at Texas from 2014-2016. In 2020, a year before re-joining Meyer with the Jags, he served as a defensive analyst for Nick Saban at Alabama. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
