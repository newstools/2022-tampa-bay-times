TAMPA — USF couldn’t overcome poor shooting, and Sam Griffin scored a game-high 23 to help Tulsa end its eight-game road losing skid with a 65-57 win Saturday at the Yuengling Center. Javon Greene had 15 points for the Bulls (7-19, 2-12 AAC), who lost their fifth in a row. Russel Tchewa added 13 points and seven rebounds, and Caleb Murphy had 10 points. “Russel is playing the best basketball of his entire life,” Bulls coach Brian Gregory said. “He’s upset with the seven shots he missed (6-of-13), but he is getting more confidence and playing well for us.” Tulsa shot 52 percent from the floor and 7-of-16 (43.8) from 3; USF shot 35 percent and was 5-of-22 (22.7) from beyond the arc. The Bulls were playing their third game in five days (and sixth in 13), partly due to COVID-19 rescheduling. “We talked about it, and our guys wanted to play the games,” Gregory said. “It is a factor, but it is not an excuse. We are playing better. We don’t have the tangible result we want, but we are playing better.” Griffin hit 4 of 6 3-pointers, and Rey Idowu had 13 points and eight rebounds for the Golden Hurricane (9-16, 3-11). USF led by as many as eight in the first half, but Tulsa used an 11-point run bridging the end of the first half and start of the second for a 38-27 lead it would not relinquish. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
