The USF football team, which begins spring practice a week from today, will conclude it with the annual spring game April 9 at Raymond James Stadium. The game begins at 6 p.m., with gates opening at 5 and parking lots opening at 4. Parking and admission are free. An alumni flag football game will be staged at halftime, with a light show and fireworks set for the postgame. The split-squad event should feature ample talent on both sides. Coach Jeff Scott indicated the team will have 80 of its 85 scholarship players, and 115 of its 120 total players, available for spring practice. USF returns 19 starters from last season’s 2-10 squad including its leading passer (left-hander Timmy McClain), top four rushers, three leading receivers and top six tacklers. The starting kicker (Newsome High alumnus Spencer Shrader) and punter (Andrew Stokes), and consensus All-American kick returner (Brian Battie) also return. The afternoon could evolve into a decisive one for what shapes up as yet another Bulls quarterback derby. Though McClain started nine games last season and often showed boundless promise, Scott recently told a Gainesville radio station that the position is up for grabs. McClain, sophomore Katravis Marsh, three-star recruit Byrum Brown and redshirt freshman Jordan Smith will participate in spring drills. Six-foot-4 pro-style recruit Gunnar Smith of Lake City arrives in June. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
