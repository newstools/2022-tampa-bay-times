A 30-year-old Brandon man has died after the bicycle he was riding was struck by four vehicles on State Road 60 in Hillsborough County on Monday, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. Two SUVs, a sedan and a pickup truck all were eastbound on SR 60 when the collisions happened near U.S. 301 around 4:30 p.m., the agency said in a news release Monday night. A 38-year-old Plant City man was driving a pickup truck in the outside left turn lane, a 61-year-old Wimauma man was driving an SUV in the outside lane and a 42-year-old Valrico man was driving a sedan in the inside lane, behind the SUV of a 32-year-old Tampa man, when the bicyclist entered SR 60 from a private roadway and began riding northbound, troopers said. As the bicyclist attempted to cross the eastbound lanes of SR 60, all four vehicles hit him, according to the Highway Patrol. The bicyclist was taken to an area hospital, where he died, the release said. None of the drivers or their passengers were injured. The Highway Patrol did not name any of the people involved in the incident.
