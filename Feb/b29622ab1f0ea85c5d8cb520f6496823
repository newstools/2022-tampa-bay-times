MIAMI — Derek Jeter announced a surprise departure from the Miami Marlins on Monday after 4-1/2 mostly unsuccessful years that didn’t come close to matching his success as a player for the New York Yankees. Jeter became CEO of the Marlins in September 2017 when Bruce Sherman bought the team from Jeffrey Loria. A five-time World Series champion during a playing career spent entirely with the Yankees from 1995-2014, Jeter earned election to baseball’s Hall of Fame in 2020. Miami went 218-327 during his four seasons at the helm, finishing with a winning record only once at 31-29 in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. In the full seasons under Jeter, the Marlins went 63-98, 57-105 and 67-95. While the Yankees are among baseball’s highest spenders, Miami was 27th among the 30 teams in payroll last year at $61 million. “I will no longer serve as CEO nor as a shareholder in the club,” Jeter said in a statement released through PR Newswire rather than the Marlins. “We had a vision five years ago to turn the Marlins franchise around, and as CEO, I have been proud to put my name and reputation on the line to make our plan a reality. Through hard work, trust and accountability, we transformed every aspect of the franchise, reshaping the workforce, and developing a long-term strategic plan for success. “That said, the vision for the future of the franchise is different than the one I signed up to lead.” • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
