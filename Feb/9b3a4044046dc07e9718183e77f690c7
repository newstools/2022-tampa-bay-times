ST. PETERSBURG — The Rays have added another power option to their bullpen depth, signing right-hander David McKay to a minor-league deal with an invite to major-league spring training. McKay, 26, is said to be fully healthy after missing the 2021 season following April hip surgery, hitting 96 mph with his fastball and spinning his slider effectively. He pitched 25 games in the majors between the Mariners and Tigers in 2019 (compiling a 5.47 ERA, with 34 strikeouts and 17 walks in 26 1/3 innings), and made one appearance for Detroit during the abbreviated 2020 season. He was a 2016 14th-round draft pick by the Royals from Florida Atlantic. The Rays previously signed free-agent pitchers Zach Erwin, David Hess, Dusten Knight, Chris Mazza (who was with them in 2021) and Aaron Slegers to minor-league deals. • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
