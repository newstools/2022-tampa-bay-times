Call them out Quack doctors should be called out | Editorial, Feb. 18 The Tampa Bay Times Editorial Board properly condemns SB 1184, which seeks to prevent discipline against medical quacks (for example, ivermectin pushers), but you did not tell us the names of those useless legislators who sponsored that horrifyingly stupid bill. Call ‘em out, so we can vote ‘em out! Charles Matthews, Tampa Just asking How dare the Legislature criminalize the vital medical care I provide | Column, Feb. 18 Setting aside a woman’s right to control her own body and the question of who will feed, clothe and educate these children that some insist be born, I wonder on the question of banning nearly all abortions after 15 weeks: If it’s all God’s will — pregnancy and the like — how would things go if the Legislature outlawed Viagra? After all, it surely must be going against God’s will to artificially help men who have erectile dysfunction. Tobey Burwick, Dunedin The power of rich white men Is America a racist country? | Column, Feb. 17 Leonard Pitts asks, “Is America a racist country?” Any honest-hearted citizen who has been an adult during the previous two presidencies can clearly see what we are. The contrast between how our first Black president was treated when compared to the spoiled son of a rich white man could not be more obvious.

Brian Walkowiak, St. Petersburg Self-serving prophecy Is America a racist country? | Column, Feb. 17 Leonard Pitts asks whether America is a racist country. Yes. America is and will continue to be a racist country as long as people such as Leonard Pitts continue to poke the embers with enflaming rhetoric. It is a self-serving prophecy of racists and leftists at large who exploit the intended targets as prey. Without it, Leonard Pitts and many like him would have to search for a real job.
