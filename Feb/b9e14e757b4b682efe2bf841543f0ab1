TAMPA — Residents from Colonial Assisted Living were evacuated after a fire above the facility’s kitchen early Tuesday morning, according to the Hillsborough County Fire Rescue. When firefighters arrived at the scene around 6:58 a.m. Tuesday, they observed smoke coming from the roof. A small fire was located in the attic space above the kitchen, the agency said in a news release, and it was extinguished quickly. Because of the location of the fire, the assisted living facility will be closed until it has been inspected and cleared by the county’s code enforcement department, the release said. The residents were put on climate-controlled public transit buses before being relocated to other facilities, according to the agency. Officials from the State Emergency Response Team and the Hillsborough County Office of Emergency Management helped relocate the residents based on the level of medical assistance each needed. Officials say it appears to have been an electrical fire, but the official cause remains under investigation. The incident was the second fire at the facility this week. Late Saturday night, a fire started in a resident’s closet, the agency said. That fire’s cause also remains under investigation, but it appears to have been accidental, according to Hillsborough County Fire Rescue. The agency reports receiving multiple fire alarm calls between Saturday and the fire Tuesday morning, during which time a restoration company was performing work on the facility’s system.
