TAMPA — Northbound lanes of Interstate-275 were reopened at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday after a fatal crash closed a portion of the interstate on the Howard Frankland Bridge for nearly 7 hours Wednesday morning, the Florida Highway Patrol says. The crash that closed the interstate began when a sport utility became disabled south of State Road 60. A van then crashed into the SUV, followed by a car hitting the back of the van, troopers say. All three vehicles were traveling in the inside lane. The impact made the SUV burst into flames and its driver, a 31-year-old Tampa man, was killed in the crash. The drivers of the van, a 29-year-old Tampa man, and the car, a 38-year-old St. Petersburg man, were not injured. Cameras showed traffic on Howard Frankland was being diverted onto Kennedy Boulevard during rush hour Wednesday, causing significant delays on the bridge. Cameras showed a burnt SUV in the middle of the interstate. The names of the three drivers involved were not released by troopers.
