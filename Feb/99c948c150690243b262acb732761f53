One of Water Street Tampa’s most anticipated new restaurants is almost here. Naked Farmer, a growing, fast-casual Tampa Bay chain that specializes in local and seasonal offerings, will open at 1001 Water St. in downtown Tampa on Saturday. The restaurant will celebrate by giving the first 200 diners a tote bag full of vegetables, and donating all profits to Metropolitan Ministries. “To be part of a community that shares our eco-conscious mission is an opportunity we welcome with open arms,” Naked Farmer founder Jordan Johnson said in a statement. “We look forward to connecting local farmers with our Tampa Bay guests through delicious food, experiences, and education.” Naked Farmer’s flagship St. Petersburg restaurant opened in 2000, with a second location in Water Street’s Sparkman Wharf later that year. The new spot was originally supposed to debut last fall, but instead joins a host of new restaurants opening this spring, including Wine on Water, the Pearl, Wagamama and Noble Rice. Another Naked Farmer is coming soon to Coral Gables. Diners can build their own bowls of salads, proteins and grains or pick from a selection of chef-curated bowls using seasonal ingredients from around Florida. Customers can dine in or get their food to go. Hours for the Water Street Tampa location are 11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday.
