Testimony is continuing today in the trial of Curtis Reeves, the retired Tampa police captain who shot and killed a fellow movie-goer in a Pasco County theater in 2014. Reeves is charged with second-degree murder in the death of Chad Oulson and aggravated battery in the injury to Oulson’s wife, Nicole, who was struck in the finger by the bullet that hit her husband. The long-delayed case has received worldwide attention. Reeves confronted Chad Oulson during the previews of the movie and told him to turn his cell phone off. Oulson flicked popcorn at Reeves, who responded by pulling out a gun and shooting him dead. After the lead detective testified Wednesday, the defense grilled him about the investigation on Thursday. Movie-goers who testified Thursday also were questioned aggressively by the defense. On Wednesday, testimony also included the playing of the detective’s recorded interview with Reeves after the shooting. You can read the full story, and listen to the interview, here.
