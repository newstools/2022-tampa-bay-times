NASHVILLE — The Lightning arrived in Nashville Friday afternoon for their Stadium Series game clearly intent on embracing the city’s rich country music history. As the team exited buses at its downtown hotel, players had cowboy hats with them. Some, like forward Alex Killorn and defenseman Mikhail Sergachev, wore them into the hotel. Others held them in hand. Injured defenseman Zach Bogosian carried his in a hat case. Expect more country-themed gear from the Lightning leading into Saturday’s game at Nissan Stadium. The NHL showcases the host city with its outdoor games. The rink will be surrounded by neon details representing the bright signs of Nashville’s Lower Broadway bars. Big-name country music acts like Miranda Lambert and Dierks Bentley will perform. And the league is inviting fans to welcome both team buses as they arrive at the stadium before the game on Saturday on Victory Avenue at Gate 9. The Lightning bus is expected to arrive at the stadium at approximately 3:15 p.m. CT (4:15 EST). The Predators bus will arrive around 3:40 p.m. CT (4:40 EST). Predators players will arrive dressed in Music City Outlaws-themed, custom-made Travis Austin wear. And given what we saw during Friday’s arrival, the Lightning should be decked out in their own country-themed clothing. Both teams are scheduled to practice later Friday at the stadium, their first time on the outdoor ice sheet. Weather has been an issue leading into this weekend, with steady rain forcing the league to work overtime to protect the ice from melting. • • • The Tampa Bay Times has commemorated the Lightning’s second consecutive Stanley Cup title with a new hardcover coffee table book, Striking Twice.
