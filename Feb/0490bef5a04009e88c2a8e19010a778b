MONTREAL — The Montreal Canadiens added former Lightning star Vincent Lecavalier and Nick Bobrov to their front office Friday. Lecavalier will serve as a special adviser to hockey operations, while Bobrov will become co-director of amateur scouting. Lecavalier, of Ile Bizard, Que., was selected first overall by the Lightning in the 1998 NHL draft. He won a Stanley Cup with the Lightning in 2004 — current Habs interim head coach Martin St. Louis was a teammate — and also spent time with the Philadelphia Flyers and Los Angeles Kings before retiring after the 2015-16 season. Lecavalier, 41, amassed 949 points (421 goals, 528 assists) in 1,212 career NHL games. Bobrov will share the scouting position with Martin Lapointe. He joins the Canadiens after six seasons as the New York Rangers director of European scouting (2015-2021) and also held that position with the Boston Bruins (2001-06). • • • The Tampa Bay Times has commemorated the Lightning’s second consecutive Stanley Cup title with a new hardcover coffee table book, Striking Twice.
