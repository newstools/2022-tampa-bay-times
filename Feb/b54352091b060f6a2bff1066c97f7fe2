Food Network star Alton Brown has a stage show in Tampa this week, and he’s already in town eating and tweeting. Monday morning, the Iron Chef host tweeted that he is relaunching Beyond the Eats, his traveling comedy and science cooking show, and was looking for restaurant recommendations in the Tampa Bay area. Brown launched the Peabody Award-winning show Good Eats in 1998, which focused on the science of cooking with a quirky sense of humor. He later went on to become the play-by-play announcer for Iron Chef America and won a James Beard Award for his first book in 2003, I’m Just Here for the Food. He is currently on a tour with his live comedy and cooking show titled Alton Brown Live: Beyond the Eats. The “culinary variety show” will be at the David A. Straz Jr. Center for the Performing Arts on Wednesday. Monday morning, Brown tweeted, “Good morning Tampa, We’re relaunching #BeyondTheEats here this week. Where do I have to eat?” The results could give a lift to a local eatery. In 2015, Brown posted a Facebook video declaring his favorite spots he ate at around the state, and Frenchy’s Original Cafe in Clearwater was one of his top picks. He recommended the Bloody Mary and said their garlic crab fries, a mix of French fries with a garlicky gravy and piles of snow crab meat, were “food crack.” On Tuesday morning, Brown posted a picture of doughnuts from downtown Tampa’s SuperNatural Food & Wine. The takeout sandwich and natural wine shop helmed by chef Wesley Roderick at 305 E Polk St. is known for its vegan sourdough doughnuts. The Fresh Cider Sourdonuts are only available in limited quantities Tuesday through Saturday.
