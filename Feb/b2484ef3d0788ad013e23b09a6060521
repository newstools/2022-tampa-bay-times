Drivers headed to Tampa from Pinellas County likely need to take the Gandy Bridge on Wednesday morning. That’s because the area’s two other bridges across Tampa Bay, the Howard Frankland and Courtney Campbell Causeway, both have significant lane closures that are backing traffic up. The Courtney Campbell Causeway has its eastbound lanes closed completely because of a crash on the Tampa side of the bridge, Clearwater police say. Officials say drivers should find alternative routes for “the near future.” The natural alternative for the causeway would be the Howard Frankland Bridge most days. But drivers should avoid it on Wednesday, as a crash there has closed the northbound lanes of Interstate-275 on the Hillsborough side and traffic is backed up significantly. Florida 511 reports the crash on the Howard Frankland happened around 2:30 a.m. and that lanes remained closed as of 7:53 a.m. Cameras show traffic from the bridge is being diverted onto Kennedy Boulevard. The Florida Highway Patrol has not released information on either crash. This is a developing story. Stay with tampabay.com for updates.
