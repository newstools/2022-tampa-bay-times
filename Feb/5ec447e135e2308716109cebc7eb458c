A 32-year-old Valrico man was found dead Friday afternoon near a retention pond after a motorcycle crash — though investigators don’t yet know when the crash occurred, the Florida Highway Patrol said. The man was riding a motorcycle south on U.S. 301 on the ramp to enter westbound Interstate 4 when he lost control for an unknown reason, troopers said. The motorcycle entered the shoulder and the driver was ejected “in or near an adjacent retention pond,” a highway patrol news release said. The man was found dead early Friday afternoon. It is unknown when he crashed or how long his body had been at the crash scene, troopers said. Highway Patrol spokesperson Sgt. Steve Gaskins said the man’s body may have been underwater at one point, but it’s hard to say, as water levels in the retention pond have dropped in recent weeks. Gaskins said the crash investigation is ongoing. The man’s name was not released. This is a developing story. Stay with tampabay.com for updates.
