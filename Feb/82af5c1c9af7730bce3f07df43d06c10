Keesha Benson, a non-profit leader and former educator, has filed to run for the District 3 Pinellas School Board seat being vacated by Nicole Carr. “I’ve been around education my whole life,” she said, in her career and as the daughter of a mother who taught for 32 years at Lealman Elementary. If elected, she would become the fourth Black person ever elected to the board, and the board would have two Black members for the first time in more than a decade. Benson, 41, is chief learning and evaluation officer for the non-profit Foundation for a Healthy St. Petersburg, but said she is resigning to run. She has worked as a lecturer at Rutgers University and assistant professor in the school of social work at Temple University, according to her bio. She has bachelor’s and master’s degrees in business from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University and a Ph.D. in social work from the University of North Carolina. A first-time candidate for public office, she lives in southern St. Petersburg, and she and her husband have three young children who attend public schools. She declined to name priorities she would pursue on the board, saying, “First I want to do a community tour, take some time to talk to parents and teachers.” Already filed in the race are Carl Zimmerman, a former state legislator and long-time teacher in Pinellas and Hillsborough counties; and Dawn Peters, a part-time personal trainer and parental rights advocate whose social media postings have praised Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, suggested “antifa” was behind the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and promoted QAnon. Southern St. Petersburg-based District 3 is one of three school board seats that represent districts but are voted on countywide.
