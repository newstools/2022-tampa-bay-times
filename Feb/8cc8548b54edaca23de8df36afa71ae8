During its 12-day run in Tampa, the Florida State Fair has set up a number of promotion days to save money on admission or rides. And new this year is a Farm Bar, where locally grown and crafted wine, beer and cider will be sold, such as Candied Apple Cider from Keel Farms. There will also be a Grove Craft Beer Garden next to the Grove Stage. There are six live music stages, dozens of agricultural exhibits, competitions and loads of free entertainment. The Florida State Fair boasts the nation’s largest midway with more than 100 rides. The visitor’s guide found at information booths includes a map to help you find the new food offerings this year, including a hot dog with a doughnut for a bun, deep-fried pickle nachos and smoothies topped with Pop Rocks.
