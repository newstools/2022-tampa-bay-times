Say, say, say, it’s been a long and winding road since Paul McCartney was last on tour. But the former Beatle has announced his U.S. Got Back tour, which will make a stop at Orlando’s Camping World Stadium on May 28. Tickets go on sale Feb. 25. McCartney’s most recent tour happened in 2019. In a news release, McCartney quipped: “I said at the end of the last tour that I’d see you next time. I said I was going to get back to you. Well, I got back!” He will also make a stop at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Fla., on May 25. A musician who really needs no introduction, McCartney’s catalogue includes some of the most classic songs in history, like Let it Be, Hey Jude, Get Back, Live and Let Die and Band on the Run. Sir Paul last played Tampa’s Amalie Arena in 2017. Tickets for the Orlando show go on sale 10 a.m. Feb. 25. Prices haven’t been announced. Tickets are available for all shows at paulmccartneygotback.com.
