Nikole Hannah-Jones, who won the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary after creating The New York Times’ The 1619 Project, is coming to St. Petersburg. The journalist will be speaking at the Coliseum on March 27 at a gala fundraiser hosted by the Woodson African American Museum of Florida. According to a release from the museum, the gala benefits the Woodson Warriors Scholarship Fund, which is now in its fourth year and currently supports 30 African American undergraduate college students from St. Petersburg. Ten more scholars will be added this spring. Several scholars will speak at the gala. “The Woodson Warriors Scholarship program is a valuable tool for local African American students to access needed college funds,” St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch said in the release. “I’d like to thank the Carter G. Woodson African American History Museum for its leadership on this important cause, as well as Nikole Hannah-Jones for lending her time to support the mission.” Hannah-Jones is a staff writer at the New York Times Magazine, and created The 1619 Project to “reframe the country’s history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans at the very center of the United States’ national narrative.” Hannah-Jones is the recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship, two George Polk Awards, a Peabody Award and the National Magazine Award. She is also the Knight Chair of Race and Journalism at Howard University, where she is currently founding the Center for Journalism and Democracy. She was named a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2021. Individual tickets cost $100, and sponsorships are available.
