In 2021, the Florida Strawberry Festival felt compelled to cancel its popular lineup of top musical acts out of concern for safety during the pandemic. This year, the stage will once again be lit up with top country, pop and rock acts. The audience will be seated in the outdoor amphitheater, and masks will not be required, though they will be handed out for free if needed. The headliners lined up this year range from rapper Nelly to country hitmakers such as Lady A and Sam Hunt to nostalgic acts like the Oak Ridge Boys, the Beach Boys and Boyz II Men. Concert tickets must be purchased in addition to festival admission. Here’s the 2022 lineup.
