ST. PETERSBURG — The Rays saw what Shane Baz could do last year in progressing from promising prospect to major leaguer. A non-roster invitee to spring camp at 21 — having last pitched competitively in 2019 at low Class A Bowling Green — Baz made it all the way to the majors and into the Rays’ postseason rotation. Solid outings during spring training — after an impressive showing during the 2020 alt site workouts when the minor league-season was cancelled) — led to Baz starting the year at Double-A Montgomery. He earned a promotion to Triple-A in June and, after side trips to pitch in the All-Star Futures Game and for Team USA in the Olympics, a September call-up to the majors. Three solid starts there were enough for the Rays to give him the ball for Game 2 of the American League Division Series against Boston. With the start of major-league spring training at least delayed due to the lockout and ongoing labor negotiations, Rays officials will be getting a closer look at the next wave of prospects and potential late-season additions. Minor leaguers are starting workouts in Port Charlotte — only players on 40-man rosters are affected by the lockout — and based on the latest prospect rankings, the Rays have plenty to see. Pitching coach Kyle Snyder, who also has attended some of the offseason mini-camps, definitely has had his eyes opened. “There’s a couple guys down there that I don’t see why they couldn’t be in the equation of impacting us at the end of the season,” he said. Even after graduating the consensus top prospect (shortstop Wander Franco) of the last two years to the majors, along with others such as Randy Arozarena, Shane McClanahan, Luis Patino and Taylor Walls, the Rays still have a top-five farm system in terms of quality and quantity. Based on rankings from three national publications, that includes six prospects among the game’s top 100, led by Baz. Here is a composite of the rankings by Baseball America, ESPN and The Athletic (MLBpipeline.com has not yet posted its rankings).
