Hillsborough County will no longer require staff members and visitors to wear masks in its facilities under most circumstances starting Monday, the county announced in a news release Friday. The policy change pertains to county facilities including recreation centers, libraries and the Frederick B. Karl County Center, officials said. Employees still will be required to wear masks during indoor programming geared toward populations that are more vulnerable to serious cases of COVID-19, according to the release. Staff members also may be required to wear masks while working at large, indoor events held at county facilities. Masks still will be available upon request for visitors. According to the release, Hillsborough County will continue to use capacity limits and virtual options for meetings and services to help limit the spread of COVID-19. While no longer requiring masks, their use is still encouraged, the news release said. “County officials will continue to work with the Florida Department of Health and other medical experts to monitor COVID-19 transmission levels in the county and will update indoor protocols accordingly for both staff and visitors to County facilities,” the release said.
