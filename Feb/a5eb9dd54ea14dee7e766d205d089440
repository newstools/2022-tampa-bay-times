To bolster the Four Oaks area in greater Carrollwood, Hillsborough County is providing free curbside pickup of junk and debris. “How a community looks can impact how residents feel. Illegal dump sites and code violations can affect health, safety, and property values throughout a neighborhood,” the county said in a news release. Beginning Friday  residents can put furniture,  junk and debris, metal, electronics and up to five tires at the curb. The county’s so-called rapid response team will haul away the items. The discarded items should be at the curb by 5 a.m. The collections will continue until Friday, March 4. The area being served is bordered on the north by Lowell Road, south to Gunn Highway, east to Pittsfield Avenue/Timberlan Sports Complex and west to Waltham Avenue. The cleanup is funded by the annual solid waste assessments paid by property owners. Hillsborough County Code Enforcement said it encourages residents to take advantage of the service and restore their property to avoid code violations. Yard waste, commercial vehicle tires, and hazardous chemicals will not be accepted. For information, call (813) 352-2473.
