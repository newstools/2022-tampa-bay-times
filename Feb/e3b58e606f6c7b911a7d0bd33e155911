TAMPA — The city’s new transfer station is designed to help better manage increased trash volume, the byproduct of the city’s growth, according to a city news release. The new 53,000-square foot McKay Bay Transfer Station, 112 S 34th St., replaces the existing dump site and has an expanded residential drop-off area with 20 parking bays staffed by attendants to help guide users through the process. The new transfer station also will contain a 30,000-square-foot tipping floor, doubling the site’s capacity and cutting wait times for large vehicles. The facility will also have a new break room and shower facility for workers, according to the release. “We know that this new transfer station will help provide an even higher level of customer service to our residents by cutting wait times and making the whole disposal process more efficient,” Mayor Jane Castor said in the release. “Additionally, customers with smaller vehicles will no longer drop off waste alongside larger vehicles, making the disposal process even safer. The new facility will also reduce wait times for commercial haulers, said Larry Washington, the city’s director of Solid Waste and Environmental Management. The new facility should be open by early spring, the release stated.
