With more “persistently low-performing” schools than any other district in Florida, the Hillsborough County school district is focusing on making improvements at 45 schools it calls the “Transformation Network.” The Tampa Bay Times took a deeper look at the 14 “transformation” schools that still have a D or an F grade from the state. They share some traits, including low test scores and large numbers of families who live in poverty. But they also vary in size, location and how often they get new principals. The information below includes metrics like the numbers of students who have left for magnet, choice and independently run charter schools, and the “stability rate,” which is the percentage of students who stayed in the school from October to February. The numbers are from the school district and the Florida Department of Education. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS MIDDLE 10201 N Boulevard, Tampa Opened: 1958 Students: 648 State grade: D Low-income: 82 percent Student stability: 87.6 percent Zoned students attending other schools: 702 Principals in the last five years: 2 From the 2020-21 school improvement plan: In science, low scores resulted from “the teacher skill in the classroom and lack of standard based instruction.... Social studies achievement had the greatest gap. The teacher skill did not meet the needs of the students.” BROWARD ELEMENTARY 400 W Osborne Ave., Tampa Opened: 1927 Students: 291 State grade: D Low-income: 90.4 percent Ready for kindergarten: 25 percent Student stability: 85.7 percent Zoned students attending other schools: 164 Principals in the last five years: 1 From the 2021-22 school improvement plan: Contributing factors to disappointing results “include lack of rigorous tasks, teacher understanding and application of standards, scholar understanding of tasks and standards, scholar application and ownership of their learning and standard mastery, consistent progress monitoring by all stakeholders, teacher vacancies, prior year standards not mastered, and scholar attendance.” ESTHER D. BURNEY ELEMENTARY 901 S Evers St., Plant City Opened: 1923 Students: 354 State grade: D Low-income: 88.4 percent Ready for kindergarten: 27.3 percent Student stability: 94.2 percent Zoned students attending other schools: 178 Principals in the last five years: 4 From the 2021-22 school improvement plan: “Learning tasks designed by teachers did not always meet grade-level standards....

GIUNTA MIDDLE 4202 S Falkenburg Road, Riverview Opened: 2005 Students: 865 State grade: D Low-income: 79.5 percent Student stability: 90.6 percent Zoned students attending other schools: 1,248 Principals in the last five years: 3 From the 2019-20 school improvement plan: “Teacher vacancies negatively impacted all areas” before the current principal arrived. “The lack of instructional coaches made it difficult to provide the level of support necessary for new teachers and building the capacity of all teachers.” CLEMMIE ROSS JAMES ELEMENTARY 4302 E Ellicott St., Tampa Opened: 1966 Students: 417 State grade: F Low-income: 93 percent Ready for kindergarten: 16.9 percent Student stability: 89.9 percent Zoned students attending other schools: 315 Principals in the last five years: 3 From the 2021-22 school improvement plan: “Teachers lacked clarity of the intended learning outcomes based on the lessons implemented in the classroom, and students lacked an understanding of learning intentions and their success criteria needed for higher achievement.” Suspensions were also frequent, especially among learning-disabled students, and the current principal has improved those statistics.

In writing, there were new teachers who did not know how to score essays. In reading, “teachers were learning how to plan to teach multiple standards, developing standards-based questions, and learning how to get students to think and speak using the standards at play.” LOCKHART ELEMENTARY MAGNET SCHOOL 3719 N 17th St., Tampa Opened: 1952 Students: 379 State grade: D Low-income: 92.9 percent Ready for kindergarten: 46.2 percent Student stability: 93.2 percent Principals in the last five years: 3 From 2021-22 school improvement plan: “Teachers (are) not fully understanding the depth of the (English/language arts) standards and how they relate to the building of content knowledge, fluency, and comprehension.” From the 2020-21 report: “Teachers are not planning rigorous and culturally responsive lessons that are grade appropriate and aligned to standards with clearly stated learning progressions and clearly defined proficiency.” MCDONALD ELEMENTARY 501 Pruett Road, Seffner Opened: 1976 Students: 541 State grade: D Low-income: 83.2 percent Ready for kindergarten: 25.6 percent Student stability: 88.2 percent Zoned students attending other schools: 174 Principals in the last five years: 2 From the 2021-22 school improvement plan: Contributing factors to overall need for improvement: “COVID absenteeism for students and faculty, high mobility, teachers with less than three years experience in intermediate grades, early implementation of online platforms.” FRANK D.

ROBLES ELEMENTARY 4405 E Sligh Ave., Tampa Opened: 1960 Students: 696 State grade: D Low-income: 92.1 percent Ready for kindergarten: 26.9 Student stability: 91 percent Zoned students attending other schools: 584 Principals in the last five years: 5 From the 2021-22 school improvement plan: “In 2019-2020 Robles faced barriers from lack of innovative teaching strategies and classroom structures, lack of home-school connection and support, low academic achievement/growth, and teacher vacancies and turnover.

Teachers also tended to start where the students were as opposed to at the depth of the standard.... In math, the coach supporting 4th and 5th grade was also teaching 3 blocks of math during the day and the coach supporting grades 6-8 was teaching 2 blocks of math a day. This did not allow for the coach to be able to effectively support teachers during their classroom instruction.” TAMPA HEIGHTS ELEMENTARY MAGNET SCHOOL 305 E Columbus Drive, Tampa Opened: 2021 Students: 312 State grade: D Low-income: 82.4 percent Ready for kindergarten: 46.5 percent Student stability: 95.8 percent Principals in the last five years: 3 From the 2020-21 school improvement plan: “There is a lack of content knowledge, standard knowledge, pedagogy, and instructional strategies in teaching math, and professional development is needed.” The same was said of English/language arts.
