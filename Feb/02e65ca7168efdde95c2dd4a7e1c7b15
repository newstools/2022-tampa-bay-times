TAMPA — A quarter-mile stretch of the outside, eastbound lane of W Waters Avenue will be closed until 6 p.m. Monday while Tampa Water Department crews repair a water main break in the Town ‘n’ Country area. The closure affects W Waters Avenue between Royal Sand Circle and Hanley Road, west of the Veterans Expressway, near the Publix at Twelve Oaks Plaza and Walmart. Drivers who use that side of the road should expect delays. Barricades and signs will be in place to direct traffic, according to the city. Drivers who pass through the construction site are asked to do so with caution. The work schedule is contingent on weather, but repairs are expected to be completed and traffic patterns returned to normal by Monday evening.
