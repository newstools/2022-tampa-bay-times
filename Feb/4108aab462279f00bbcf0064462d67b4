A national tour to promote the upcoming release of The Batman starring Robert Pattinson will bring the Batmobile and costumes from the movie with a free pop-up display Saturday at Tampa’s Armature Works. The iconic car has been redesigned for the film, which opens March 4 in theaters. It will be there, as will the costumes for Batman, Catwoman, the Riddler and the Penguin. “The public will see firsthand the specially-designed muscle car and costumes in a free, branded pop-up display with photo and prizing opportunities,” a news release from Warner Bros. Pictures announced. The reboot of the franchise is set in his second year of fighting crime as Batman uncovers corruption in Gotham City while pursuing the Riddler, a serial killer who targets Gotham’s elite. “We wanted the Batsuit and the Batmobile to look obviously like it was designed by one man, by Batman himself,” said producer Dylan Clark in the news announcement. “The suit is tactical, it’s military, it’s purpose-driven, it’s practical. It’s also iconic; Batman has his own emblem, his cowl, his cape. We chose a design that Bruce Wayne, at 30 years old, would have built.” The film stars Pattinson as Bruce Wayne and his alter ego Batman, alongside Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman, Paul Dano as the Riddler and Colin Farrell as Oswald “Oz” Cobblepot, the Penguin. The pop-up display will be open 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturday at Armature Works, 1910 N Ola Ave., Tampa.
