DADE CITY — Motorists near Interstate 75 in Pasco County got some good news when Overpass Road reopened Monday morning for one lane of traffic in each direction between Old Pasco Road and Boyette Road. Overpass Road was closed a year ago to allow the $64 million construction of the new interchange at Interstate 75. Since then, road construction has brought several detours, slowdowns and closures for that construction to continue, including the demolition of the previous overpass and construction of the new bridge. The interchange allowing traffic on and off the interstate at Overpass Road cannot be accessed yet since it is still under construction and is not expected to open until later in the year or early next year, according to a release from the Florida Department of Transportation. As part of the project, the contractor has also built a new neighborhood access road at Old Pasco Road to replace the former Blair Drive connection to Overpass Road. In the northeast quadrant, McKendree Road has been realigned to connect to Boyette Road just north of Overpass Road. The Monday opening of the two lanes is for vehicular traffic only. No bicycle or pedestrian traffic is allowed. Construction of sidewalks is also continuing. State road officials urge motorists to not exceed the posted speed limit of 30 mph on the newly-opened roadway for both worker and public safety. Motorists should also expect to stop at Boyette Road and Old Pasco Road. When the road is completed, it will include traffic signals at Old Pasco Road and at the two intersections to and from the Interstate 75 ramps.
