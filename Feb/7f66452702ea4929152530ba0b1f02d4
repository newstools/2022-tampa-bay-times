A group assaulted a driver on a Pasco County highway after crashing into his car Monday afternoon, the Florida Highway Patrol said in a statement released Saturday. Three men riding in a red sedan were traveling behind a 2007 Chrysler 300 in the center lane of State Road 54 near Hospital Boulevard. The sedan changed to the left lane, sped up and passed the Chrysler before going back into the center lane. It then stopped and caused a crash. The driver and two passengers got out of the sedan and attacked the Chrysler driver, “punching and kicking” him in the middle of the highway, the release said. The three men fled the scene. The Chrysler driver, a 45-year-old Port Richey man, had minor injuries. Investigators asked anyone with information on the case should contact the highway patrol or Crime Stoppers at 800-873-8477.
