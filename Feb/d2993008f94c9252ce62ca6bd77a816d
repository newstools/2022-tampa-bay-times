While the NFL’s latest cycle of headcoach hirings didn’t cost him a coordinator, Bucs coach Bruce Arians’ staff didn’t emerge totally unscathed. Veteran inside-linebackers coach Mike Caldwell, instrumental in the development of Pro Bowler Devin White, among others, reportedly is set to join the Jaguars as defensive coordinator. The NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo reported Tuesday that Jacksonville is working on a deal to bring Caldwell aboard. A former linebacker who played 11 NFL seasons, Caldwell, 50, played and later coached with new Jaguars coach Doug Pederson in Philadelphia. An NFL assistant the past 14 seasons, Caldwell never previously has been a coordinator. Behind his position group, which included White and veteran Lavonte David, the Bucs have ranked first in the league in rushing yards allowed per game (82.5) and per attempt (3.72) since the start of the 2019 season. He inherits a defense that forced a league-low nine turnovers, gave up 27 points per game (28th in the NFL) and allowed 353.1 yards per game (20th) in 2021. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
