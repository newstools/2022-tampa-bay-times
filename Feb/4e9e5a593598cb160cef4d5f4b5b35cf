One of St. Petersburg’s tallest buildings is one step closer to completion. The forthcoming 334 St. Pete Residences topped out its construction on Friday at 24 stories and 250 feet, which will make it one of the city’s tallest residential buildings, and one of the tallest west of Beach Drive, when it opens next year. “This is a landmark project in St. Petersburg, and we are very proud of the high quality and safe work we are doing with all of our trade partners,” Sean DeMartino, Central Florida president for Coastal Construction, said in a statement. Located across from Publix on a block that once housed the American Stage Theatre Company, 334 St. Pete Residences is being developed by Miami’s American Land Ventures, which also built the nearby Camden Pier District apartments. It will feature 220 upscale condominiums plus ground-level retail and a parking garage. Announced in 2018, the project was delayed in part by the pandemic before breaking ground in March 2021. Since then, builders have poured 21,500 cubic yards of concrete and erected 2,217 tons of rebar and 52,334 square feet of glass, according to Coastal. American Land Ventures has said Baby Boomers are the 334 St. Pete Residences’ target market.
