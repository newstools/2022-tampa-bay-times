NEW PORT RICHEY — Pasco County Commissioners last week formally celebrated a Declaration of Friendship with the District of Germersheim, Germany, which honored more than a decade of partnership in educational, cultural and economic development efforts. German consul general Andreas Siegel thanked commissioners for the recognition and the ongoing cooperation between the two communities. He was assigned to his diplomatic duty to Florida in July of 2019. The commission’s formal resolution recognizing the relationship states that Siegel “has been actively involved in efforts to promote the trade relationship between Florida and Germany. These efforts include providing guidance to Pasco County during its most successful trade mission to date.” The Declaration of Friendship approved by commissioners in October “establishes the basis for developing and promoting the transatlantic exchange of mutually beneficial information, cooperation and furthers the relationship and understanding between the peoples of the District of Germersheim and Pasco County.” County officials noted that they expect to see new economic development successes that should be official soon because of that ongoing working relationship.
