Under siege by its much larger and more powerful neighbor, Ukraine has been so far able to slow down Russia’s attack, a senior U.S. defense official said Sunday morning. But there is a long fight ahead. “The Russians have been frustrated. They have been slowed. They have been stymied, and they have been resisted by Ukrainians, and to some degree, they’ve done it to themselves in terms of their fuel and logistics and sustainment problems,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to brief reporters. “But as I said earlier, we would expect them to learn from these issues and adapt to them and try to overcome them. So I think we all need to be very sober here. in recognizing that this is combat, and combat is ugly, it’s messy, it’s bloody, and it’s not wholly predictable. And to that end, Ukraine is calling on foreigners who want to help. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has created “The International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine.” It is a new effort, a Ukrainian official tells Military Times, to help bolster the fight. Several veterans have reached out to Military Times interested in helping Ukraine. Before you go, this is what you need to know, according to the official, who spoke to Military Times Sunday on condition of anonymity in an interview repeatedly interrupted by ongoing airstrikes. Here’s what veterans, other U.S. citizens or anyone else interested in helping out, need to know. - Military Times
