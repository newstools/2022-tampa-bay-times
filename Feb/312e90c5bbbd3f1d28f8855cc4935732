The creamsicle Bucs throwback uniforms are returning, just not soon enough for the consummate throwback quarterback to brandish one. The team announced Monday it will wear its old-school attire, complete with the “Bucco Bruce” helmet logo, at an undetermined game in 2023. It will mark the first on-field appearance of creamsicle in more than a decade; the NFL stopped holding throwback games in 2013 after instituting a rule limiting teams to one set of helmets for an entire season. But the league issued a memo last summer allowing each team to add one alternate helmet to its uniform closet starting in 2022, essentially clearing the way for teams to wear throwback uniforms next year. The Bucs will have to wait an additional year. “Due to global supply-chain challenges, we will have to wait one more year than hoped,” the team said in a news release on its website. “This is the earliest that Nike can finish production of the orange uniforms.” The prevalent hope among the fan base was that throwback games — and Tom Brady — would return in 2022. Brady will be 46, and presumably out of football for more than a year, when the 2023 season kicks off. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
