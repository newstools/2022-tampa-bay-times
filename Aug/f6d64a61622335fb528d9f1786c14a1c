ST. PETERSBURG — The Rays made a small deal Monday to bolster their bullpen depth, acquiring left-hander Garrett Cleavinger from the Dodgers. Cleavinger, 28, has pitched parts of three seasons in the majors with the Phillies and Dodgers, with a career record of 2-5 and a 4.70 ERA. He has spent most of this season at Triple-A Oklahoma City, striking out 47 over 29 innings in 22 games with an 0-2, 2.79 mark. In four games with the Dodgers, he is 0-1, 10.38, working just 4-1/3 innings. To get him, the Rays gave up German Tapia, an 18-year-old outfielder hitting .329 with the Dominican Summer League team. To make room on the 40-man roster, they designated for assignment right-handed reliever Luke Bard, who was 1-1, 1.93 in eight games. The Rays have three healthy lefty relievers in the big leagues in Jalen Beeks, Colin Poche and Brooks Raley, so Cleavinger is initially headed to Triple-A Durham. Cleavinger has some Rays’ connections via past transactions. A third-round pick by the Orioles out of Oregon in the 2015 draft, he was first traded to the Phillies in a July 2017 deadline deal for former Rays rookie of the year pitcher Jeremy Hellickson. The Dodgers then got him in December 2020 as part of a three-way deal in which the Rays sent lefty reliever Jose Alvarado to Philadelphia. • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
