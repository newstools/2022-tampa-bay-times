BRADENTON — A burglary suspect in Bradenton trying to escape police officers jumped into a pond and never resurfaced, authorities said Saturday. Police officers had responded to reports of vehicle burglaries at an apartment complex in Bradenton early Saturday and found two men hiding on the porch of an apartment, the Bradenton Police Department said in a news release. Officers detained one of the men, but the other man jumped a fence and ran down an embankment into a pond. The 19-year-old suspect went underwater and never resurfaced, the news release said. A dive team from the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office found the suspect’s body a short time later. The body was sent to the medical examiner’s office to determine a cause of death.
