Hyde Park Village is getting another boutique from a renowned fashion label: Rag & Bone. The New York brand, known for its denimwear, tees and footwear, will open a store this fall at 1620 W Snow Ave. in Tampa, next to fellow fashion shops Zimmermann and Zadig & Voltaire. The 3,191-square-foot store will feature both men’s and women’s denim, footwear and accessories; and will have a lounge area and rotating gallery of murals and works by local artists. It’ll be the brand’s third store in Florida, and first outside South Florida. Rag & Bone has fewer than four dozen stores nationwide, though its products are available through retailers like Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus. “We are counting the days until Rag & Bone’s opening,” Hyde Park Village general manager Nicole Gee said in a statement. “This news, coupled with the upcoming arrival of Zimmermann, is going to keep Hyde Park Village buzzing with some of the most dynamic fashion brands in the world.” Over the last two years, Hyde Park Village owner-managers WS Development have opened or announced a number of new projects, from stores by mega-brands Nike and Sephora to boutiques like Zimmermann and Kittenish. Last month, developers announced plans to open a boutique hotel there called Palihouse Hyde Park Village.
