Cash said Margot  could he used off bench tonight or Wednesday but the best plan is allow him to rest through Thursday’s off day. With the Rays facing Angels lefty Reid Detmers, Brujan is starting in right field.

He loaded the bases by allowing a single, a walk and a single, forced in one run by walking Mike Trout and then allowed the first career grand slam to Shohei Ohtani. Of some historical note, Faucher became the third pitcher making his big-league debut to give up a grand slam to a reigning league MVP, joining Philadelphia’s Zach Eflin (June 14, 2016, to Toronto’s Josh Donaldson) and St. Louis’ Walter Brown (May 16, 1947, Boston’s Ted Williams).
