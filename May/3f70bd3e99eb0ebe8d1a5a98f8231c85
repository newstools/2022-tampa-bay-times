TAMPA — Bucs quarterback Tom Brady, who in his later years has indulged in a bit of self-deprecation, reportedly is raising the stakes. To mass deprecation. Variety has reported that the 45-year-old future Hall of Famer will be the initial target in a series of Netflix comedy specials called “Greatest Roasts of All Time,” or “GROAT.” He’ll even serve as executive producer of his own roast and future ones, the report indicates. The Brady roast will be filmed at the end of the 2022 season. “To quote my good friend Marshawn Lynch … ‘I’m just here so I won’t get fined,’” Brady said, referring to the former NFL tailback. Clearly, the roasters will have a smorgasbord of material to fling at Brady. Expect barbs about his age, his avocado-tequila binge at the Bucs’ Super Bowl celebratory parade in 2021, the periodic sideline tantrums, and his 2020 gaffe in Chicago, when he lost track of downs in the waning moments of a one-point loss to the Bears. The list of roasters will be announced at a later date. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
