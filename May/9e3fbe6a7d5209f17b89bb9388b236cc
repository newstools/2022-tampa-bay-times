Hit the beaches early on Memorial Day. Don’t wait too late to start the grill. And if you’re boating, “keep your eye on the sky,” National Weather Service meteorologist Ross Giarratana said Sunday. Monday morning should be dry and sunny. But by 4 p.m., thunderstorms will start rolling along I-75 and drenching Tampa Bay with up to 2 inches of rain. There’s an 80% chance that most of the region will get wet between 5 and 7 p.m., he said.	Tampa International Airport hasn’t reported rain in four days. Temperatures for the holiday will peak around 92 degrees, Giarratana said. Waves will be small.	Tuesday and Wednesday share similar forecasts.
