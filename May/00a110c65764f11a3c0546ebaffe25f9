The largest law firm in Florida is moving its Tampa office to a new home. Cole, Scott and Kissane, P.A., has signed a lease for 42,500 square feet  across three floors at Westshore 500, an office building at 500 N Westshore Blvd. The Miami-based firm plans to move from its current Tampa space at Corporate Center IV, 4301 W Boy Scout Blvd., by August 2023. The move will make Cole, Scott and Kissane, which has more Florida attorneys than any other Sunshine State firm, the largest tenant in Westshore 500. The relocation actually represents a slight shrinking of the firm’s office footprint, as it’s leasing just under 50,000 square feet at its current space. But the move will help the firm operate more efficiently, said Caleb Lewis, managing director at commercial real estate services firm JLL, which brokered the deal. “This relocation coincides with the increasing trend of how law firms are becoming more efficient now that attorneys and staff are coming back to work in greater numbers,” Lewis said in a statement. “The firm’s new space will have a more efficient layout, offering more room for additional attorneys.” About 100 employees will work out of the new Tampa space, spread across the fifth, seventh and part of the sixth floors at Westshore 500.
