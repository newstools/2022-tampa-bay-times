For six months of the year, three days a week, groups of men, ages 49 to 75, meet at North Shore Park to play games. It’s modified fast-pitch softball through the St. Petersburg Half Century Club at North Shore Park. “70 is the new 50,” said Peter Beauregard, 72. “I just figured [if] I can still do this at my age, I’m lucky as hell. That’s the key, how lucky we are all to still be out here.” Some have played most of their lives, for fun or in school, or coached softball or baseball. All share a love for competition. Games are lively with energetic players laughing and cheering, some heated disagreements over plays. It’s all part of the game. Players say they enjoy the warm weather, exercise and community. Many discovered the club as snowbirds escaping Northern winters and now live in the area full time. “You become like a family after a while and it’s hard to give that up,” said Peter Golenbock, 76. The club recently completed its 89th season and the team is always looking for new players.
