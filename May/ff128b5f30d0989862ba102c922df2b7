The Rays will go as right-handed as they can against Yankees lefty Nestor Cortes in tonight’s opener of the four-game series. The Rays have six right-handed hitters and three switch-hitters in the lineup, with Harold Ramirez at first base and Manuel Margot in centerfield. Wander Franco is at DH, but manager Kevin Cash said it was more for preventative purposes than additional issues with his legs, and that Franco was expected to play shortstop for the next three games. Cortes has held left-handers to a .100 batting average and .393 OPS; right-handers have done slightly better with a .192 average and .562 OPS. Lefty Ryan Yarbrough will start for the Rays, who are coming off a two-game sweep of the Marlins. The Yankees added former Cardinals All-Star infielder Matt Carpenter, and he is not only active for tonight’s game but was added to the lineup when Aaron Hicks, who was to bat leadoff and play centerfield, was scratched.
