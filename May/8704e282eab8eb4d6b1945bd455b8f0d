A 30-year-old Plant City man is dead after he was ejected during a crash on State Road 60 in Hillsborough County on Monday, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The man lost control of his pickup truck, which crossed the median into the eastbound lanes and overturned near Smith Ryals Road around 3:24 p.m., the agency said in a news release. He was ejected from his vehicle. A single-unit box truck driven by a 27-year-old Vero Beach man struck both the pickup truck and its driver, troopers said. The Plant City man was taken to an area hospital, where he died. The Florida Highway Patrol did not name either driver involved in the crash.
