Former Florida Gators quarterback Emory Jones announced Thursday that he is transferring to Arizona State. ESPN first reported the news. Jones signed with the Gators as a top-100 prospect in Dan Mullen’s inaugural 2018 recruiting class. The Georgia native saw time as a change-of-pace option over the next three seasons before taking over as the starter last fall. His performance was mixed. Though he led UF with 758 rushing yards, his 13 interceptions ranked among the most in the nation. Jones strongly considered entering the transfer portal after UF’s loss to UCF in Tampa’s Gasparilla Bowl but stayed. Briefly. He announced his intention to transfer after the first week of spring practice when it became clear that Anthony Richardson was healthy. Richardson, who battled Jones for playing time last year, is one of the most talented quarterbacks in the country and has already shown up on way-too-early mock drafts as a potential first-round pick next year. Jones’ commitment cements his departure from UF. Assuming Richardson earns the starting job — a very good bet — Ohio State transfer Jack Miller is the Gators’ likely backup. The Sun Devils needed an experienced quarterback after Jayden Daniels transferred to LSU. Daniels appeared in 29 games at Arizona State, accounting for 45 touchdowns (13 rushing, 32 passing) over three seasons. Jones will be playing under former Bucs assistant Herm Edwards. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
