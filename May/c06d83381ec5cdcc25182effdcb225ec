Aspirational singers and dancers ages 8-21 have the opportunity to audition for a new upcoming production that will tour the country in 2023. A national search for “Hits! The Musical” kicks off in Tampa on June 4. The song and dance production features music in genres of pop, rock and roll, Hollywood and Broadway. Auditions take place all over the country and conclude on July 24 in Miami. Once the cast of 22 has been selected, “Hits! The Musical” will begin a 50-city tour on March 1, 2023, that runs through May 9, 2023. The production is presented and directed by Cynthia Nekvasil, the founder of Tampa’s Entertainment Revue, a song and dance ensemble that was established in 1989. “Hits! The Musical” is an updated version of Entertainment Revue, which has seen many of its members go on to become recording artists and perform on Broadway. The musical’s founder and producer is Bob Gries, a Tampa-based business executive and philanthropist. “A show of this caliber, with all young people, has never been done before but it’s going to be spectacular,” Gries said in a news release. “This is an incredible experience for these young performers,” Nekvasil said in the release. “At this age, there are few national opportunities for exceptional young singers and dancers.” The Tampa audition happens at 8:30 a.m. June 4 at the Holiday Inn Tampa Westshore - Airport Area. 700 North Westshore Boulevard.
