Mick Hubert, the longtime voice of the Gators, is retiring after 33 years and more than 2,500 football, basketball and baseball games. Known for his distinctive “Oh my!” call, Hubert is stepping down after this weekend’s home baseball series against South Carolina, Florida announced Thursday. “That’s going to be it,’’ the 68-year-old told UF. “This wasn’t the end of a five-year plan. I don’t know if I can explain how I knew, but I knew. I had been considering this for a little while. I just had to do some praying about it and enjoy every game.” Hubert and his wife, Judi, plan to move to Sarasota next week. Hubert, an Illinois native, has been a mainstay of Gator games since 1989, when he was hired away from a broadcast station in Dayton, Ohio. He called the Gators’ three national titles in football plus their two in men’s basketball and one in baseball. He was inducted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame in 2018. “It’s just time,” Hubert said. “It’s just time for me to go.” The Gators plan to honor him during the baseball series and during a football game this fall. “Mick Hubert has shared his immense talents and represented the Gators incredibly well for the past 33 years,” athletic director Scott Stricklin said via the school’s site. “All of Gator Nation will be eternally grateful for providing the soundtrack for so many special Gator athletic moments. “It’s hard to imagine a UF football or basketball broadcast without his voice being a part of it. Mick is a true pro and one of the all-time greats. We wish him and Judi the very best in the next chapter of their lives.” Hubert is the second longtime college sports announcer to announce his retirement this year. Florida State’s Gene Deckerhoff had his farewell during the Seminoles’ spring game last month. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
