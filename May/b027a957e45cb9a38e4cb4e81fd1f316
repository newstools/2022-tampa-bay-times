BUSHNELL — A 19-year-old Spring Hill woman was among two people killed in a four-vehicle collision in Sumter County on Friday, the Florida Highway Patrol reported. Troopers said a 30-year-old Bushnell man was driving a sport utility vehicle east on County Road 48, east of SE 10th Street, at about 7 p.m. Friday. The driver traveled off the right side of the road while trying to negotiate a curve, then overcorrected and entered the westbound lane where three vehicles were oncoming, according to a Highway Patrol report. The SUV collided nearly head-on with a car driven by the Spring Hill woman, then continued eastward and hit the front end of an SUV driven by a 54-year-old Weeki Wachee woman. The Bushnell man was ejected from his SUV and suffered fatal injuries. His SUV rotated and collided with a third vehicle driven by a 48-year-old Eustis woman. The drivers from Weeki Wachee and Eustis suffered serious injuries, according to a Highway Patrol report. The Highway Patrol did not release the names of any of the people involved in the crash.
