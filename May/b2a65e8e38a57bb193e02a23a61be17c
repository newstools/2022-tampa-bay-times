The Tampa Bay Times and the City of Clearwater Community Redevelopment Agency present True Florida, a photo and essay contest inspired by and in coordination with the “America’s Everglades Through the Lens of Clyde Butcher” photo exhibit (through May 31, 2022) and “Daydreaming: Niki Butcher’s Hand-Painted Photography” exhibit (June 15, 2022-Jan. 31, 2023) at the Clearwater Main Public Library. The prompt: What is your favorite natural resource in the Tampa Bay area and why? Photo and essay submissions will be accepted May 25-June 29. Photo winners will be chosen by the Butcher family. Essay winners will be chosen by a panel of four judges from the Times. 1. Essay and photo winners will be published in the Times on Sunday, Aug. 21. 2. The contest is open to Florida residents. There are two groups for each medium: Adults ages 18 and older and students ages 13-17. 3. Enter and find more information at tampabay.com/trueflorida. There will be two different entry points — one for photos, one for essays.
