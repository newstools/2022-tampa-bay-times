SEATTLE — The Rays are looking to make it a clean sweep of the Mariners in today’s finale of the four-game series and extend their season-high win streak, with first pitch at 4:10 Tampa Bay time. Manager Kevin Cash said the Rays are pleased to have first baseman Ji-Man Choi back in the lineup after he was idled for about a week due to right elbow irritation caused by loose bodies. Choi said he felt good and Cash said he looked normal during an extensive pre-game workout Saturday. The Rays are hoping he picks up where he left off as he had been one of their hottest hitters. To make room on the active roster for Choi, the Rays optioned infielder Isaac Paredes back to Triple-A Durham. Cash said they were impressed with Paredes, who was acquired from Detroit at the end of spring training for Austin Meadows. The Rays will have Ryan Yarbrough on the mound, as he seeks a better performance than his rough season debut in Oakland on Tuesday. Yarbrough had been out since the start of the season with left groin tightness and had two abbreviated and unimpressive rehab appearances for Triple-A Durham. The Mariners have called up their top pitching prospect, George Kirby, to make the start. The Rays and Mariners players will be wearing, and using, a lot of pink gear and equipment today in a salute to Mother’s Day.
