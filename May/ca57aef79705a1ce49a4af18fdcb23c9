SEATTLE — The Rays are looking to extend their season-high win streak to six tonight when they face the Mariners, first pitch at 9:10 Tampa Bay time. The Rays made a roster move before the game, sending down lefty Josh Fleming, who had another unimpressive outing, and bringing up right-handed reliever Ralph Garza Jr. for the second time this season. Fleming was 2-3, 6.38 overall in six outings. Over his last five, he allowed 23 runs (13 earned), 24 hits and nine walks in 15 innings. The Fleming demotion will lead to lefty Jeffrey Springs moving into a starter or bulk inning role on Monday in Anaheim, which allows the Rays to push back the next start for Corey Kluber (to Tuesday) and Shane McClanahan (to Wednesday), giving them an extra day’s rest. Drew Rasmussen, who was born near Seattle and grew up across the state in Spokane, will be on the mound for the Rays tonight, with 40-plus relatives and friends in the stands. Lefty Marco Gonzales starts for Seattle. Also of note Saturday, though the Rays have won five 5 straight games in their navy jerseys, they are wearing gray tonight. That was because the Mariners opted to wear their dark blue jerseys - at the choice of Gonzales. The home team gets to pick, and teams can’t wear similar colors. Ji-Man Choi joined the team in Seattle for a pregame workout, saying his previously sore right elbow felt “good” and is expected to be activated on Sunday.
