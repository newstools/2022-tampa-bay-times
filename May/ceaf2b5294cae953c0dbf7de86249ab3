BALTIMORE — Andrew Kittredge, the Rays’ top high-leverage reliever, was placed on the 15-day injured list before Sunday’s game due to low back tightness. KIttredge last pitched Monday and has been battling the back issue for the past few days. He tried to throw off the bullpen mound Sunday morning but that didn’t go well. Manager Kevin Cash said they hope that shutting Kittredge down from throwing will help alleviate the issue and he can return in short order. Reliever Dusten Knight, who was with the Rays for a one-game stint in April, was called up and re-added to the 40-man roster. To make room there, the Rays shifted reliever JT Chargois from the 10-day to the 60-day injured list. On Friday, he had a major setback in his return from a previous left oblique issue, sustaining a Grade 2 strain that will keep him out for several months. Cash said both Yandy Diaz (left shoulder strain) and Wander Franco (right quad) were feeling better and could be used off the bench Sunday if needed. Outfielder Manuel Margot continues to progress in his return from a right hamstring strain, with plans to play in extended spring training games Monday and Tuesday, and be ready to be activated when eligible Wednesday.
