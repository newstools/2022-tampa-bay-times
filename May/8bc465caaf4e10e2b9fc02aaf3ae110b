For the first time since closing a decade ago, the historic Beach Theatre is finally showing movies again. For now, it’s happening outside. As renovations continue at the building at 315 Corey Ave., The Beach Theatre and the city of St. Petersburg are hosting a summer film series at Horan Park. Titled “Judy at 100,” the series features movies from Judy Garland’s filmography on each Wednesday in June. The screenings are free to the public. To raise funds for the ongoing renovation, The Beach Theatre Community Foundation is selling raffle tickets and movie posters. The Beach Theatre first opened in 1940. It was purchased by Hollywood screenplay writer Michael France Jr. in 2007. He ran it until his health declined in 2012. The beloved powder-blue and white building, known for its Art Deco facade, sat dormant until it was purchased by Scott Commercial Holdings in August 2021. Architects have been crafting new plans for the space, which include “a large foyer that will provide a welcoming space to greet future theater goers, as well as state-of-the-art technical upgrades.” According to the release, finding a contractor is the next step. “The renovation has started, albeit slower than we would like!” said owner Christopher Scott in a press release. “Our team sincerely appreciates the support and continued interest shown towards our project. We have high hopes to welcome you back soon!” If you go “Judy At 100″ takes place at 8 p.m. on Wednesdays in June at Horan Park, 7701 Boca Ciega Drive, St. Pete Beach, 33706. Attendees can bring blankets and chairs, though tarps, umbrellas and sightline-restricting items should be left at home. Urban Popcorn will sell fresh craft popcorn, while Mastry’s Brewing Company and The Spice & Tea exchange will peddle drinks starting at 7 p.m. Visit www.spbeachtheatre.org/summer-film-series for more information.
