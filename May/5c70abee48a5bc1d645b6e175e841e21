TAMPA — The grind is just getting started. Here in mid-May, with only one tense, taxing playoff series in the books, any excessive talk of a Lightning three-peat remains premature. But at this juncture, we at least can acknowledge the possibility that the Bolts soon could be breathing rarefied air. Only 11 teams in what is widely deemed major college and pro sports (NFL, NBA, NHL, Major League Baseball, college football, college hoops) have pulled off a three-peat or better in the last 50 years. The Lightning are trying to crack the elite pantheon of Jeter’s Yankees, Jordan’s Bulls and Geno’s Huskies. In some circles, that’s called immortality. Here’s a look at the 11 three-peat specialists of the last half-century: UCLA men’s basketball Seven consecutive national titles (1967-73) Technically, this untouchable streak precedes the past half-century, but we’re including it because it ended 49 years ago. The West Coast dynasty built by John Wooden never will be matched; college sports’ current parameters (or lack thereof) aren’t conducive to roster stability, and patience is at a premium. UCLA didn’t even reach a Final Four until Wooden’s 14th season. Oakland A’s Three consecutive World Series titles (1972-74) A generation before the A’s of general manager Billy Beane thrust sabermetrics into the mainstream, Oakland had an eccentric owner (Charlie Finley), sterling defense, a slugger or two and the best pitching in baseball. The A’s totaled 16 runs in topping the Reds in seven games in 1972 and needed only 21 to top the Mets in seven games the following season. Three members of the dynasty (Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter, Rollie Fingers) are in the Hall of Fame. So is Dick Williams, the manager in 1972 and 1973. Montreal Canadiens Four consecutive Stanley Cups (1976-79) The Habs of the polyester era remain arguably the most complete team in NHL history. Every nook of the roster featured a Hall of Famer, from the bench (coach Scotty Bowman) to the wings (Guy Lafleur, Steve Shutt) to the net (Ken Dryden). The 1976-77 team posted the NHL’s best regular season ever (60-8-12) to that point, outscoring its opposition by 216 goals. New York Islanders Four consecutive Stanley Cups (1980-83) For now, the Lightning dominance that has skated across our psyche the last two-plus seasons pales in comparison to what this suburban dynasty achieved. An unassuming ensemble led by sniper Mike Bossy (who scored 50 goals in as many games in 1981), the Islanders won 19 consecutive playoff series, a record unapproached since. Seven members of the group are in the Hockey Hall of Fame. Chicago Bulls Three consecutive NBA titles (1991-93) Three more NBA titles (1996-98) The first phase of the Bulls dynasty featured Michael Jordan at his absolute prime. His airness was named league and NBA Finals MVP in 1991 and ‘92, when Chicago won 61 and 67 regular-season games, respectively. Physically taxed by consecutive extended seasons and the 1992 Olympics, Jordan still averaged 41 points in the 1993 finals against the Suns, winning his third finals MVP honor. After nearly a two-year hoops hiatus, during which he pursued a pro baseball career, Jordan found his groove again in short order. When rebounder extraordinaire Dennis Rodman also came on board in the 1995-96 season, the Bulls established what was then the best regular season record (72-10) in NBA history. Two seasons later, the Bulls dynasty bowed out gloriously, with Jordan juking Utah guard Byron Russell with a crossover dribble and nailing a game-winning jumper at the top of the key to clinch an 87-86 win in Game 6, capturing the franchise’s sixth NBA crown in eight seasons. Tennessee women’s basketball Three consecutive national titles (1996-98) Pat Summitt’s program already owned three national titles when 6-foot-2 prep sensation Chamique Holdsclaw arrived in 1995. Behind the New York native and a glistening supporting cast, the Lady Vols won national titles in each of Holdsclaw’s first three years, capped by the school’s first perfect season (39-0) in 1997-98. Injuries thwarted the chance at a four-peat the following season. New York Yankees Three consecutive World Series titles (1998-2000) Nearly 40 years after the Bronx Bombers’ mythical run through the 1950s and early ‘60s (eight titles in 13 years), their dynasty was resuscitated. Joe Torre, Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Jorge Posada, Bernie Williams and Andy Pettitte served as the cornerstones this time around. The 1998 club (114-48), which swept the Padres in the World Series, still is regarded as one of the best ever. Los Angeles Lakers Three consecutive NBA titles (2000-02) More than a decade after the Laker dynasty known as “Showtime” concluded, the franchise was re-booted by Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O’Neal and coach Phil Jackson. Bryant earned the first of nine All-NBA Defensive first-team honors in 2002 as L.A. won 67 games. The following year, he and O’Neal both averaged more than 28 points as the Lakers lost only one playoff contest. In 2002, O’Neal won his third consecutive finals MVP honor as L.A. swept the Nets. Connecticut women’s basketball Three consecutive national titles (2002-04) Four consecutive national titles (2013-16) The Huskies already had won a pair of national titles (1995, 2000) when Naismith National High School Player of the Year Diana Taurasi arrived in 2001. The final ingredient Coach Geno Auriemma needed for an already-formidable lineup, Taurasi led UConn to a 39-0 mark and national title by her second season in 2002, and ultimately helped UConn win 70 consecutive games. The program’s four-peat a decade later was sparked by the arrival of another national player of the year, Breanna Stewart. Led by the 6-foot-4 matchup nightmare, UConn posted two undefeated seasons during Stewart’s four years, never lost an American Athletic Conference game and accounted for the bulk of an NCAA-record 111-game win streak.
