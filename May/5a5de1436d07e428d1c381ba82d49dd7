Florida is getting national attention for its housing market explosion and lack of affordability. A recent report from Realtor.com found that the Tampa Bay metro area had one of the largest year-over-year rent increases in the country from February 2021 to February 2022. The region also had one of the highest percentages of people spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing. As advocacy groups call for rent stabilization and local governments vow to designate funds to build more affordable housing, longtime residents face eviction. Below is a list of resources to turn to if you are or someone you know are at risk of losing your housing. The services offered range from legal counsel to rental assistance, and food and healthcare providers. Representatives from the agencies said it is important to get in touch as early as possible if you fear falling behind on rent or need assistance.
