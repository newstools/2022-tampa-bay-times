Part of Morris Bridge Road in Zephyrhills was closed Friday afternoon due to a hole that suddenly swallowed part of the roadway. By about 1:30 p.m. on Friday, the hole was about 4 feet wide in the middle of the northbound lane of Morris Bridge Road. Neither Pasco County nor city of Zephyrhills officials would go so far as to call the hole a “sinkhole” when the closure was announced. However, the county has confirmed that a geotechnical team has been called to the scene to determine the stability of the roadway. Until then, the county has closed Morris Bridge Road in both directions between State Road 54 and Chancey Road. That means drivers will have limited access to the area around the Leisure Days RV Resort, Charity Baptist Church and Chester Taylor Elementary School. Signs along Morris Bridge Road are directing drivers to alternate detour routes. It’s the second time this month that the ground beneath a Zephyrhills roadway has suddenly given way, forcing detours and lane closures. On May 4, a hole swallowed portions of Chancey Road and grew to approximately 6 feet wide and 4 feet deep, Pasco County officials said. That hole forced county leaders to temporarily close the road between 6th Avenue and Copeland Drive due to safety concerns. That roadway has since been reopened. County leaders are continuing to monitor the situation along Morris Bridge Road and are posting periodic updates to social media accounts. This is a developing story. Check back for updates.
