ST. PETERSBURG — A shimmery substance was visible in recent days on a patch of water off downtown near Demens Landing Park. On Sunday, someone reported the issue to the city via the SeeClickFix website, writing that a “large, very visible gas/oil leak” was discoloring the water around the St. Petersburg Municipal Marina. They attached pictures showing a sheen on the water’s surface. A hazy blue, patchy shimmer was still visible Monday morning in the same area. It drifted along the seawall and under a small bridge connected to Demens Landing. The Tampa Bay Times asked a city spokesperson for information about the sheen, whether the city knows what caused the discoloration or had any other information to share. The city spokesperson said they were working on a response but had nothing to report on Monday. An official “Mayor’s Action Center” account on the SeeClickFix website replied to the original poster, saying it had forwarded the report to the St. Petersburg Stormwater Department.
