Like its sister park Busch Gardens, SeaWorld Orlando also had a coaster ready to open in 2020 and kept it on ice for two years. SeaWorld’s first launch-style coaster, Ice Breaker, came out of hibernation in February. It has both backward and forward launches to flip riders’ stomachs with what it says is the “steepest beyond vertical drop” in Florida, from 93 feet high at an unnerving 100-degree angle. The latest addition gives SeaWorld more roller coasters than any other theme park in Orlando (Busch Gardens still holds the Florida crown), further evidence that it has shifted toward rides and away from animal performance attractions in recent years. But there are some new animal presentations. Dolphin Adventures, which opened last May, explores the world of bottlenose dolphins. Also new is the Sea Lion and Otter Spotlight, which opened last July. It still has some of the comedy of the old Clyde and Seamore shows, but it has a more educational bent. For dining, the new Altitude Burgers offers a build-your-own-burger bar. This summer brings the return of Electric Ocean, running weekends May 27-Sept. 5 with DJs putting on a family-friendly dance party. The nights end with a fireworks show and dancing fountains. Special events this summer include a Guy Harvey Weekend June 18-19, with special appearances by the renowned artist and conservationist. The park ends the summer with a Craft Beer Festival, running weekends Aug. 5-Sept. 5. If you go $89.99, age 3 and younger free. Parking is $30. 7007 Sea World Drive, Orlando. 407-545-5550. seaworld.com/orlando.
