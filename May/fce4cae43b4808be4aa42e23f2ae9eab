TALLAHASSEE — Florida lawmakers on Tuesday reached a deal to overhaul Florida’s condominium laws after the catastrophic collapse of Champlain Towers South in Surfside last year left 98 dead. The legislative proposal will be added to a special session agenda that originally was called to address only Florida’s ailing property insurance market. House and Senate negotiators had failed to reach a deal on condo reform during the 2022 regular session earlier this year after legislators couldn’t agree on forcing thousands of condominium owners across Florida to be subjected to potentially massive fees for repairs of their aging buildings. “The Florida Legislature has grappled with reaching a consensus on what meaningful reform looks like, but today we have arrived at an agreement that will help to ensure this kind of tragedy never happens again,” House Speaker Chris Sprowls, R-Palm Harbor, said in a statement. Some key elements of the new legislation are: During the regular legislative session that ended in March, lawmakers considered legislation that would impose statewide re-inspection requirements for aging buildings and address the financial reserve requirements needed to pay for any needed repairs. But the bills died when the Senate and House reached an impasse. The Senate refused to require condo associations to hold reserves to pay for structural repairs, allowing a two-thirds vote of owners to waive reserves, while the House refused to back off its requirement that there be no waiver of reserves. The 101-page bill will be considered this week. Its first hearing is scheduled at 6 p.m. Tuesday in the House Appropriations Committee. This is a breaking news story that will be updated.
