There’s a new watering hole at St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport. Three years after it was first announced, St. Petersburg brewery 3 Daughters Brewing on Wednesday finally began pouring at a new bar and restaurant for travelers inside the airport. The pub, operated by concessionaire SSP America, is located past security in the Gate 2-6 area. The bar will feature 3 Daughters favorites like Beach Blonde Ale and Bimini Twist IPA, as well as menu items, like sandwiches, wings and pretzels with beer cheese sauce. “Having a branded 3 Daughters Brewing bar at PIE means travelers can start their trip with one of the most popular local craft beer, cider or seltzers,” Brian Horne, 3 Daughters’ vice president of sales and marketing, said in a statement. “It also means they can get one last ‘taste of Florida’ before they depart our region.” St. Pete-Clearwater International announced in 2019 that it was revamping its food and beverage options by bringing in local brands like Mazzaro’s Italian Market, which opened in 2020. “Bringing this popular concept to PIE is an important part of developing a welcoming and thriving airport and destination,” airport director Tom Jewsbury said in a statement. It’s one of 3 Daughters’ first outposts outside its main brewery in St. Petersburg. Earlier this year, the brewery opened a rooftop bar in Clearwater. It also announced its Florida Orange IPA will be featured this spring on flights on Allegiant Air, the airport’s dominant carrier.
