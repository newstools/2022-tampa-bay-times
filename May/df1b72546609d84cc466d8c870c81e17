Though we haven’t reached peak rainy season in Tampa Bay, this weekend will feel like we’re in the heart of July. The region has a 60 percent chance of rain Friday and Saturday, while Sunday has a 50 percent chance, according to the National Weather Service’s Ruskin office. The rain will be accompanied by high temperatures in the low 90s each day and lows in the mid-70s. While rain is likely for the weekend, government meteorologists say there is also a slight chance of thunderstorms each day. The first significant showers will come after 2 p.m. Friday, the weather service says, along with winds between eight and 13 mph. A chance of showers and thunderstorms will then persist through the evening and overnight into Saturday morning. Saturday into Sunday has a nearly identical forecast. The rain will slow down by Sunday evening but not entirely. There will still be a 30 percent chance of showers, followed by a return to a 50 percent chance of rain on Monday and Tuesday. With this weekend’s forecast, some may be wondering in Tampa Bay: Have we reached the time of year where showers can be expected each afternoon? Not quite in Tampa Bay, says the National Weather Service. The agency established last year that the region’s rainy season officially runs from May 25 to Oct. 10 — 10 days behind Southwest Florida’s start date of May 15. Just like how storms form before the June 1 start of hurricane season, however, these “rainy season” dates are arbitrary. The dates were determined using data dating back to 1981 that compares daily averages to predict when the rain is most likely to come in droves.
