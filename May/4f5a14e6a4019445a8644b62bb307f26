We are so grateful to readers who have contributed during our Tampa Bay Times weeklong fundraising drive that concludes tomorrow. We appreciate you! The goal is to raise $50,000 — which is enough to pay the salary of a journalist in our newsroom; or to improve our photo equipment; or pay for documents, data or travel to tell more stories. As of 10 a.m. Saturday, we were at $36,762. Online, we’ve seen gifts ranging from $10 to $2,500. We’ve also gotten $3,718 in checks. And we have pledges of more. All this to say … we’re getting close. There is still time to help us reach our goal, and I hope you’ll consider a donation of any size. The campaign ends at 11:59 p.m. Sunday. I also want to share a sampling of the uplifting comments readers have left on our fundraising page: “We love all the local reporting and coverage, from investigative and politics to sports and the arts. Keep going!” — Al and Linda Humphers “Thank you for your crucial public service. The survival of American democracy depends upon the high quality, independent, investigative journalism the Times provides.” — Carmine Bell “More than ever we need great news organizations like the TBT to keep us informed. Thanks to all of you, we appreciate your hard work.” — Trish Jansen You can read all the comments left by readers at www.tampabay.com/support We are heartened by the encouraging words and the generous outpouring of support. Thanks again!
