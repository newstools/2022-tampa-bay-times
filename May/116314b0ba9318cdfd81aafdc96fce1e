DESTIN — As the college football world waits for an update on the Jimbo Fisher-Nick Saban feud, Missouri coach Eliah Drinkwitz provided some closure to another: some previous barbs involving him and now-former Florida Gators coach Dan Mullen. Drinkwitz said it’s “not true at all” that he has beef with Mullen. They do, however, have an interesting history. It started in 2020 with a halftime brawl after a Tigers defensive player delivered a late hit on UF quarterback Kyle Trask. Mullen and Drinkwitz yelled at each other, and Mullen revved up the home crowd afterward. Mullen then made headlines for wearing a Darth Vader Halloween costume in his postgame interview. Drinkwitz responded a year later, after his overtime victory over UF, by whipping out a lightsaber and saying “May the Force be with you” at the end of his news conference. Missouri’s win ended up being the final blow to Mullen’s tenure. “Those of you all who know me know that I make jokes,” Drinkwitz said Tuesday during the first day of the SEC’s spring meetings at the Hilton Sandestin. “That was not intended to harm him.” That, however, was not the only dig from Drinkwitz. He made another on a Jacksonville radio station after Mullen was fired. “If you sow kindness, you reap kindness,” Drinkwitz said then. “If you sow jackass ability, you get jackass ability.” On Tuesday, Drinkwitz said he “probably got carried away in the heat of the moment.” “I’m still learning how to be a head coach,” said Drinkwitz, who was the head coach for a season at Appalachian State before spending the last two at Mizzou. “That wasn’t one of my finest moments.” Drinkwitz called Mullen a “brilliant offensive mind” with “plenty of opportunities left in him as a head coach.” We’ll have more the SEC spring meetings later today. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
