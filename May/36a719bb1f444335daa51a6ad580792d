Sephora is opening inside hundreds of Kohl’s locations across the nation — including two in Central Florida. The makeup retailer opened two stores on Friday in Lutz and Lakeland, according to a statement, and are among the 400 openings Kohl’s announced in partnership with Sephora. The new Sephora north of Tampa is in the Kohl’s at Northgate Square on 3979 Van Dyke Road. Lakeland’s newest Sephora is at the open-air mall Lakeside Village on 1401 Town Center Drive. The partnership between Sephora and Kohl’s launched in 2021 with 200 locations after the cosmetics brand announced it would be phasing out of JCPenney stores. Kohl’s said in a statement it plans to expand Sephora to 800 of its stores by 2023. The Sephora at Kohl’s will each be about 2,500-square-feet and similar to freestanding Sephora stores, the statement said. In addition to makeup, skincare, hair products and perfumes, Sephora has trained “beauty advisors” who can offer personalized consultations and assist customers looking for products. Florida is set to have 14 Sephora at Kohl’s locations by the end of 2022, Kohl’s said, including locations in Clearwater, St. Petersburg, Brandon and Sarasota.
