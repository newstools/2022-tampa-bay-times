TAMPA — Bucs wide receiver Travis Jonsen was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence after police say he was straddling lane markers, speeding and weaving as he drove along N Dale Mabry Highway early Monday. Tampa Police officers saw the car driving in a manner “indicative of impairment,” according to a news release. He was stopped at 1505 N Dale Mabry Highway, “exhibited several clues of impairment” and was arrested at 3:18 a.m. Jonsen, 25, refused to take a breath test following his arrest, according to the release. He was released from jail Monday morning after posting a $500 bond. Jonsen, an undrafted free agent from Montana State, spent parts of the past two seasons on the Bucs’ practice squad, earning a Super Bowl 55 ring in 2020. He played in all three preseason games in 2021, catching three passes for 25 yards. But even before his arrest, Jonsen faced some tall odds of earning a roster spot. The Bucs receiver position is one of the deepest on the team, especially with the addition of Falcons free agent Russell Gage in the offseason. “We expect members of our organization to uphold the high standards that have been established,” Bucs general manager Jason Licht said in a statement. “We are aware of the situation regarding Travis Jonsen earlier this morning and will refrain from further comment at this time while the legal process continues.”
