PHOENIX — The Rowdies came back from an early deficit for a 5-1 victory against Phoenix late Sunday in a USL Championship matchup. It’s the first time in Phoenix’s franchise history that it has given up five goals at home. The Rowdies (4-3-4) are in fifth place in the Eastern Conference standings with 16 points. Phoenix took the lead in the 15th minute on Luis Seijas’ goal. The Rowdies tied it in the 24th minute on a give-and-go between Jake LaCava and Leo Fernandes. Fernandes’ backheel pass into the left side of the penalty area allowed LaCava to score at the near post. Dayonn Harris scored in the left corner of the net in the 36th minute for a 2-1 lead. The Rowdies added another before the halftime as Jake Areman scored. About a minute into the second half, Steevan Dos Santos’ shot got past Phoenix goalkeeper Ben Lundt and was turned into the net by Phoenix’s Sivert Haugli as he tried to make a clearance inside the 6-yard area. In the 68th minute, a low cross by the Rowdies’ Sebastian Dalgaard was redirected by Ryan Flood into the net for a second own goal by Phoenix.
