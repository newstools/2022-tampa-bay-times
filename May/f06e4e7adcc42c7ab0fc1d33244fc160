Maybe the water was still too cold. Maybe you were waiting for the snowbirds to leave and for tourist season to (slightly) subside. Maybe you simply haven’t been able to squeeze in the precious time needed for a beach day escape. If you haven’t started soaking up the rays at some of our unparalleled, pristine beaches, may I suggest you do so very soon?
