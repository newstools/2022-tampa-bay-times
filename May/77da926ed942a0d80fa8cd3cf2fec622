ST. PETERSBURG — In looking to take tonight’s opening game of the series with the Tigers, the Rays will face a former fan in Tampa native Alex Faedo. Faedo, the son of long-time Alonso High coach Landy Faedo, is making his third big-league start at a stadium where he attended many games as a kid. Tonight, he will be on the mound and have dozens of family and friends in the stands watching him. (Side note: Landy was an assistant coach at Gaither High when Rays manager Kevin Cash played there.) “We’re happy he’s here,” Landy Faedo said Monday afternoon. “It’s exciting.” Faedo, who pitched for Alonso High and then the Gators, has allowed runs over five innings in each of his first two starts, against the Pirates on May 4 and the A’s on May 10. The Rays put Lowe on the injured list Monday afternoon due to what they are calling low back discomfort. Infielder Isaac Paredes, who was acquired from Detroit in the late spring trade for Austin Meadows, was called up. Meadows won’t be playing this series either, as he was placed on the injured list due to vertigo. Meadows made the trip and is staying at his Ruskin home; he will be  seeing some doctors, but according to manager A.J. Hinch won’t be at the Trop during the three-game series. The Rays are starting veteran Corey Kluber, seeking to bounce back from a rough May 10 start at the Angels in which he allowed eight runs on 11 hits in three innings.
