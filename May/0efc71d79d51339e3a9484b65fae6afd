La Segunda buys Faedo Family Bakery: The owners of Ybor City’s La Segunda Bakery have purchased the iconic Seminole Heights Faedo Family Bakery at 5105 N Florida Ave. It’s the latest expansion for the beloved local purveyors of Cuban bread, who this spring opened their first St. Petersburg location on Fourth Street N. Though that spot operates as a full cafe, for now, the owners say they plan on using the Faedo bakery location for bread-baking only. Twisted Indian soft-opens: After months of delays and construction setbacks, Twisted Indian is now open. The restaurant, located at 2639 Central Ave. in St. Petersburg, features the same fast-casual Indian menu popularized at their Baum Avenue Market location and their food truck at the Saturday Morning Market. Chef shuffle at The Library: Chef Rachel Bennett, who has helmed the kitchen at St. Petersburg’s The Library for the last four years, is now the executive chef at Tampa’s The Stovall House. The Bayshore Boulevard social club is owned by the Oxford Commons group (which also runs The Library and Tampa’s Oxford Exchange). Moving up at The Library is former sous chef Alex Hoaks, who is taking Bennett’s place as the restaurant’s new executive chef. Matoi Sushi closes: Long-running Tampa sushi restaurant Matoi Sushi has closed after 35 years. The folks behind Zukku Sushi, with restaurant concepts at Tampa’s Armature Works and in Wesley Chapel, Lakeland and Charlotte, N.C., are set to open a new restaurant inside the Dale Mabry Highway location.
