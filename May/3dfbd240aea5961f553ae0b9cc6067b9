TAMPA — It’s another year of disappointment for long-suffering Maple Leafs fans. With a 2-1 win, the Lightning eliminated Toronto in Saturday’s Game 7, extending the Maple Leafs’ drought of not winning a postseason series since 2004. Lightning forward Nick Paul notched the pair of goals — his first career playoff scores — and Andrei Vasilevskiy made 23 saves. But in news that bears watching for the Lightning faithful, fellow forward Brayden Point exited the game early with an apparent lower-body injury. Tampa Bay will face the Panthers in the second round. Florida, which won this year’s Presidents’ Trophy with 122 points, defeated Washington on Friday in a six-game series.
