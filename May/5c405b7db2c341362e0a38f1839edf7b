ANAHEIM, Calif. — A day after being no-hit by Angels rookie lefty Reid Detmers, the Rays face a mighty challenge today in Shohei Ohtani. The Angels’ two-way star is coming off a dazzling outing in Boston, working seven shutout innings and striking out 11. The Rays again are without Manuel Margot, who remains out of the lineup since leaving Monday’s game with right hamstring tightness. Manager Kevin Cash said Margot felt a lot better today, could have played, full expects him to be back in lineup Friday vs. Blue Jays. Also, Wander Franco — playing his 100th regular-season game in the majors — will be the designated hitter today as the Rays wrap up a three-city, 10-game West Coast road trip and a stretch of games on 16 straight days, having lost three straight. Cash said the DH day was planned for Franco, who has been dealing with leg issues. The Rays do, however, have their top starter, Shane McClanahan, on the mound, which should greatly improve their chances by keeping the game close. McClanahan has been matching up with several top starters but has the added challenge today of also pitching to Ohtani. Here is the Rays’ lineup, including Brett Phillips, who in limiting Ohtani to a double during his relief outing in the eighth inning Tuesday dubbed himself, “the better Shohei.” And for the Angels, who are giving Mike Trout a day off: • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
