TAMPA — Now here’s a reason for fans of the Guinness and camaraderie of the old Four Green Fields pub to celebrate, Irish or not. The re-created version of the popular thatched-roof bar near downtown opens at last — Thursday night in the Channel District. “Drumroll please. … We are proud to announce that our opening night for the new location is this Thursday 5-26-22!!! We have live music & the best Guinness around. Be the first to check out the new location, doors open at 7 p.m.,” read a recent post on the pub’s Facebook page. For nearly three decades, the original bar on Platt Street was a popular gathering spot for beers, fish and chips, a game of darts and what the Irish call “craic” — enjoyable conversation. Sinead O’Connor and the Wolfe Tones played their music there. So for Fields fans — some who actually wept as it closed in December 2020 — it’s been a long time coming. Owner Colin Breen found a 16,000-square-foot warehouse at 802 N 12th St. for the Fields’ next incarnation, in a prime position between busy Ybor City and the thriving Channel District and in the shadow of a Selmon Expressway overpass. Breen had hoped to be open by the end of January, but encountered delays. The new location includes a microbrewery in back and a whiskey tasting room. It will have the same layout and the original green door from the Platt Street pub. A life-size mural has been painted outside to make it look like customers are walking into the original bar. Four Green Fields pubs already exist at Curtis Hixon Park downtown and at Tampa International Airport, but for diehards, it was always the original Platt Street location. The authentic Irish pub building has since been knocked down.
