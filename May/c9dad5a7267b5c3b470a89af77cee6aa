ST. PETERSBURG — The Rays lost another key member of their lineup to injury, with second baseman Brandon Lowe placed on the 10-day injured list due to what the team is calling low back discomfort. Isaac Paredes was called up from Triple-A Durham to take Lowe’s spot. Manager Kevin Cash said Lowe was being seen by a doctor on Monday and that evaluation will determine the exact nature and severity of the injury, as well as the expected length of his absence. “Don’t know yet,” Cash said. “It’s (10) days, I know that. So that’s the best I can do on that.” Cash said Lowe had been managing the issue since last week, at the end of the 10-day West Coast trip. Though off to a slow start, Lowe is one of the Rays’ top offensive performers, hitting 39 homers last year. The Rays already are without outfielder Manuel Margot, who was placed on the injured list Sunday due to a right hamstring strain. Paredes, who was called up earlier this season with the Rays, was acquired from the Tigers in the late-spring trade for Austin Meadows, now on Detroit’s injured list due to vertigo. • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
