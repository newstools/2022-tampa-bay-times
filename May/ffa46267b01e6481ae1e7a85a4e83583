BALTIMORE — The Rays are trying to beat the Orioles again today and win the three-game series but will do so without shortstop Wander Franco or third baseman Yandy Diaz in the lineup. Franco has been dealing with ongoing leg issues and is currently sidelined with right quad discomfort, which surfaced late in Friday’s game. Diaz left Saturday’s game in the sixth inning with a left shoulder strain after a somewhat awkward headfirst slide at home. Corey Kluber will be on the mound for the Rays, starting a few days past the one-year anniversary of his no-hitter for the Yankees against the Rangers. The Orioles are starting Spenser Watkins.
