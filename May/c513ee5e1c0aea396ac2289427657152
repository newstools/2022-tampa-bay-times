ST. PETERSBURG — A 39-year-old motorcyclist was killed Friday night in a crash on 38th Avenue North. St. Petersburg Police said the man was driving a black Harley Davidson motorcycle east on 38th Avenue North, approaching 34th Street North, when a red Chevy Traverse traveling in the opposite direction made a left turn into the motorcycle’s path. The motorcyclist crashed into the front passenger corner of the Traverse, police said. The man was transported to Bayfront Health St. Petersburg where he was pronounced dead. His name was not released Saturday because his family had not yet been notified, police said. The driver of the Traverse was not injured and was released from the crash scene after talking to investigators. This crash is under investigation.
