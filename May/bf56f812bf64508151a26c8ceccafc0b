A Pasco County high school teacher was arrested Tuesday amid allegations that he had sex with a student, according to the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office. Skyler Seidenberg, 30, faces a felony charge of an authority figure soliciting or engaging in sexual conduct with a student, jail records show. He was placed on administrative leave from Sunlake High School, 3023 Sunlake Blvd., Land O’ Lakes, where he was a social studies teacher, according to Steve Hegarty, a spokesperson for Pasco County Schools. In an automated phone call Tuesday, Principal Kara Merlin told parents the administration was informed about a possible inappropriate relationship between a student and teacher Monday afternoon, and the school contacted the Sheriff’s Office. After the Sheriff’s Office contacted the student, the teen told a deputy they had consensual sex with Seidenberg on three separate occasions at his home, according to an arrest affidavit. The student confirmed Seidenberg was their teacher. In a “controlled” call with a deputy, Seidenberg said nothing happened with the student until they were of age, but, he added, “obviously it’s still probably illegal or whatever, or whatever is going to happen” because he was the teen’s teacher, the affidavit said. The teen’s parents are aware of the arrest, Merlin told parents in the automated call, and counseling services have been offered to the teen. She said the Sheriff’s Office told her there is no evidence that Seidenberg had sex with any other student. “As you are aware, our Sunlake staff is outstanding and works hard every day to benefit our students, and their health, safety, and wellbeing is our highest priority,” Merlin said in the phone call. “That’s what makes this news all the more shocking and disappointing.” Seidenberg has been employed by the Pasco County School District since 2019, Hegarty said.
