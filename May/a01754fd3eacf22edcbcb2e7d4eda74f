TAMPA —Joseph Citro, who took four tries before winning a spot on Tampa City Council, was elected chairperson of the seven-member body for the next year by a 4-3 vote Thursday morning. Citro was nominated by Charlie Miranda and supported by Luis Viera. Lynn Hurtak, selected last month by council members to replace John Dingfelder, who resigned over a public records lawsuit settlement, also supported Citro. Citro had nominated Hurtak to the city’s Variance Review Board and supported the Old Seminole Heights civic activist’s selection to her own citywide seat. “I look forward to a wonderful year as chair of City Council and helping the city of Tampa,” Citro said moments after the vote. Orlando Gudes, who resigned as chairperson in late March after the city found he had created a hostile work environment for a former aide, nominated Bill Carlson to be chairperson. Guido Maniscalco voted for Carlson, too. Maniscalco was elected as vice chairperson. After Gudes stepped down, Maniscalco took over as chairperson for about a month until Thursday’s regular election.
