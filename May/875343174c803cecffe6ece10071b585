Hot on the heels of rapper Kendrick Lamar’s new album dropping today comes an announcement of his The Big Steppers tour, which makes a stop at Tampa’s Amalie Arena on July 27. The new album, Mr. Morale and The Big Steppers, has been long anticipated as it’s his first studio album in five years. His 2017 album DAMN won five Grammy Awards and won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2018, making Lamar the first rapper to achieve that prize. Lamar brings special guests Baby Keem and Tanna Leone on the tour, which is sponsored by Amazon Music, Rotation and Cash App. As a special promotion, Cash App customers get early access to tickets on May 19 from 10 a.m.-10 p.m. via Ticketmaster.
