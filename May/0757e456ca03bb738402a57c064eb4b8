ORLANDO — The parks that Harry Potter put on the map are turning to dinosaurs and Jason Bourne as another way to lure movie fans. Universal Orlando’s biggest new addition is the envelope-pushing Velocicoaster, the Jurassic Park-themed coaster that opened last June in Islands of Adventure. Like the movies it is based on, the ride is a pulse-pounding attack on the senses. The long, winding line to get on the coaster is filled with fun distractions, from snarling animatronic raptors in holding cells to a chance to grab some selfies with a raptor. The ride has more than 4,700 feet of track, multiple moments of airtime, two launches, four inversions and a twisting barrel roll over the water. Afterward, stop by the new Raptor Encounter, where you literally come face-to-face with a ferocious velociraptor, which makes for a very entertaining photo op. The Bourne Stunt Spectacular, found in Universal Studios, opened last June. The queue is heavy with scenes from the movies and props from the films, including a motorcycle from The Bourne Ultimatum and a replica of the Mini Cooper from The Bourne Identity. The preshow stars actor Julia Stiles from the films telling the audience to be on the lookout for Jason Bourne. It has a sliding set with lots of projections that make it hard to tell where reality ends and the special effects begin as the illusion of movement is helped by the screen behind it. Coming soon, maybe this summer, is a reboot of Revenge of the Mummy, one of Universal Studios’ most popular attractions. For dining, the new Bigfire open-fire cooking restaurant and Bend the Bao, an Asian fusion concept, have opened at CityWalk. And Universal Studios recently added a kiosk in its New York section called Central Park Crepes, making both savory and sweet crepes served in a funnel. If you go $109, $104 ages 3-9, age 3 and under free; two-park tickets $164, $159 for children. Parking is $27, free after 6 p.m. at CityWalk. 6000 Universal Blvd., Orlando. 407-363-8000.
