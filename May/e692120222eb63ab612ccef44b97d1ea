Cybersecurity company Rapid7 is on the move. And it won’t have to go far to get there. The Boston firm, which opened a large hub in Tampa last fall, has signed a lease for 42,000 square feet across two floors at Sparkman Wharf, part of the $3.5 billion Water Street Tampa development from Lightning owner Jeff Vinik and Bill Gates’ Cascade Investment. The company had already been working from Industrious, a shared workspace at Sparkman Wharf, while it looked for a permanent home. Water Street Tampa was always on the shortlist of locations. “As we continue our quest to build the workplace of the future, Sparkman Wharf is the ideal location for us to place our roots,” Jamie Kinch, Rapid7′s vice president of real estate and workplace experience, said in a statement. “We will be in the center of the tech boom, and — with Water Street Tampa’s mixed-use design, restaurants and recreational amenities — it gives us the unique opportunity to build a meaningful community.” The close proximity of other tech operations — such as ReliaQuest, which will move into new headquarters in a Water Street office tower later this year, or startup accelerator Embarc Collective — was another plus, said Mike Griffin, executive managing director of commercial real estate brokerage firm Savills, which worked with Rapid7 on finding a new home. “It’s rewarding to see such an exciting, innovative company come to Tampa,” Griffin said in a statement. “The team at Savills worked to select Tampa in a competitive national search process and ultimately Water Street Tampa was chosen as the top location to attract talent.” Rapid7 has said it plans to hire at least 100 employees in Tampa, and possibly up to 500 in the coming years.
