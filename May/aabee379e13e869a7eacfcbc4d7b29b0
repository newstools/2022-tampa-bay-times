Tampa Bay Times Investigative Editor Rebecca Woolington, part of a reporting team that won the 2022 Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting, threw out the first pitch at the Tampa Bay Rays-Detroit Tigers game at Tropicana Field on Wednesday. Woolington was part of a trio of reporters with Eli Murray and Corey G. Johnson who exposed dangerous conditions at a Tampa factory, the only lead smelter in Florida. The investigation also found that pollution from the factory had seeped into the neighborhood. The series has prompted stronger regulatory oversight of the Gopher Resource factory and resulted in fines of more than $800,000. This year’s Pulitzer is the second in a row for the Times — 14th overall.
