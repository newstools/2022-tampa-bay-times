Tampa’s Museum of Science and Industry is being invaded by dinosaurs this summer thanks to a blockbuster animatronic exhibit that opens this weekend. Dinosaurs Around the World, which has broken attendance records at science museums in the U.S. and Europe since it launched in 2017, features more than a dozen life-like animatronic dinosaurs that offer a paleontological journey back in time. And there’s a Florida connection. Florida State University professor Gregory Erickson, who was recently featured on the PBS show NOVA, is one of only 150 full-time professional dinosaur paleontologists in the world. He served as an adviser, writer and editor of all paleontology copy. The exhibit is included with admission and the maker space in the museum’s Idea Zone also has dino-themed activities like fossil casting and dino digs. It opens Saturday and runs through Sept. 5. Visitors will find out how continental drift, sea level fluctuations and volcanic activity allowed dinosaurs to disperse to all corners of the globe. They will also touch fossil casts and find out about modern-day dinosaurs.
