WESLEY CHAPEL — A Wesley Chapel teenager faces two charges of vehicular homicide after the Florida Highway Patrol said he was driving 114 mph and making multiple lane changes just before a January collision on State Road 56 that left two people dead. Memphis James Frizzell, who was 17 at the time of the Jan. 19 accident, was taken to the Pasco County Detention Center following his arrest, the Highway Patrol reported. Troopers said the crash occurred at 2:49 p.m. on Jan. 19 at the intersection with Lajuana Road as a 52-year-old man was driving a 2017 Nissan Rogue east on State Road 56. He had a 56-year-old woman in the vehicle as his passenger, troopers said. The man turned left at the intersection and was hit by a westbound 2017 Honda Accord driven by Frizzell, troopers said. The SUV overturned and the driver, who troopers said was not wearing a seat belt, was ejected. The passenger was wearing a seat belt and was removed from the wreckage by passersby, troopers said. The driver and passenger, both from Wesley Chapel, were killed. The Highway Patrol has not publicly released their names. Troopers arrested Frizzell Friday after an investigation indicated he made multiple lane changes while traveling 114 mph just prior to the crash and his speed at the time of the impact was 100 mph.
