TAMPA — Lightning defenseman Victor Hedman on Monday was named a Norris Trophy finalist for the sixth consecutive season. The trophy, which will be awarded between Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup final, goes “to the defense player who demonstrates throughout the season the greatest all-around ability in the position.” The Predators’ Roman Josi and Avalanche’s Cale Makar also were nominated by the Professional Hockey Writers Association. Hedman won the award in 2017-18, the only Lightning player to do so. He finished third the other four previous times he was nominated (2016-17, 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21). Josi won the award in 2019-20. Makar was a finalist in 2020-21, when the trophy went to the Rangers’ Adam Fox. Hedman, 31, placed second among NHL defensemen with 65 assists in 82 games this season. He was third in goals (20) and points (85). His six game-winning goals tied Makar and the Blues’ Justin Faulk for most among blueliners. Former Red Wings defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom was the last player to be named a Norris finalist for six straight seasons, from 1997-98 through 2002-03. The Hall of Famer won the trophy seven times in his 20-year career. Josi became the NHL’s highest-scoring defenseman in 29 years with 96 points in 80 games. Only six defensemen in the past 50 years have had more in a single season. His 58 assists are the most by a defenseman since Sergei Zubov’s 77 in 1993-94. Makar scored 28 goals, becoming just the fifth defenseman in the past 30 years to score that many. He ranked second among blueliners in points (86) and ranked fifth in plus-minus rating (+48). Lightning forward Alex Killorn is a finalist for the Masterton Trophy, awarded to the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to the game.
