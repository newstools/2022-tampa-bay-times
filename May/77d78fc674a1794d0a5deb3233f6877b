ST. PETERSBURG — A small plane crashed into a fence at the St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport on Monday after the aircraft’s brakes failed upon landing, an airport spokesperson said. A pilot flying alone in a twin-engine Cessna landed on the airport’s primary runway about 2:45 p.m. and realized the brakes were not working, said Michele Routh, an airport spokesperson. The runway, 18/36, runs north-south, perpendicular to Ulmerton Road. To avoid Ulmerton Road, the pilot turned the Cessna and crashed into another fence that runs along Stoneybrook Drive, which stopped the plane on airport property, Routh said. The pilot was not injured but crews were on scene to clean up a fuel spill. The airfield was closed and Federal Aviation Administration officials were headed to the airport to clear field for re-opening. The incident was causing delays to commercial flight operations, Routh said. No other details were immediately released.
