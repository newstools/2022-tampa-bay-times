ST. PETERSBURG — After falling behind early, the Rowdies score three unanswered goals for a 3-1 win against Pittsburgh on Saturday night at Al Lang Stadium. The Riverhounds’ Alex Dixon started the scoring in the 10th minute when a low shot deflected off Rowdies center back Aaron Guillen and caught goalkeeper CJ Cochran going in the wrong direction. Tampa Bay (5-3-4) steadily grew into the match as the first half wore on. Leo Fernandes was denied by Pittsburgh goalkeeper Jahmali Waite in the 16th minute, and shortly afterward Steevan Dos Santos sent a header an inch or two wide right of goal. The Rowdies tied the score on a set piece in the 36th minute. Lewis Hilton played a short corner kick to Jake Areman, who then played the ball back for Sebastian Dalgaard. Dalgaard played the ball back to Hilton, who shot from the sideline to the far post. Laurence Wyke kept the ball alive and got it back in front of goal, where Jake LaCava stripped it from a defender and put it into the back of the net. Fernandes put the Rowdies ahead in the 57th minute, and Lucky Mkosana ended the scoring deep into stoppage time in the second half. Mkosana controlled a long ball over the top from Wyke and then moved his defender off the ball before blasting a half volley into the goal.
