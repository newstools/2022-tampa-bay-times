ARLINGTON, Texas — Kevin Kiermaier has done a lot during parts of 10 seasons with the Rays. But tonight led to an unexpected first — in the lineup as the DH. Manager Kevin Cash saw it as a way to keep Kiermaier’s hot bat in the lineup after playing him four straight days. Kiermaier said when bench coach Matt Quatraro approached him on the Sunday night flight to Texas with the news, he thought it was in jest. “I never thought I’d see the day,” Kiermaier said. After Kiermaier texted his wife, Marisa, with the exciting news, he started figuring out how he will stay busy between innings as he tends to get a little restless, deciding he likely will spend most of his time in the cage, trying to not take too many swings. The Rays return to the scene of the 2020 neutral site World Series feeling pretty good, having won their last two against the Yankees. The Rays were 2-1 here last June. Drew Rasmussen will be on the mound for the Rays tonight, facing the Rangers for the first time in his career and looking to continue his impressive run, having allowed no more than three runs in any of his nine starts and with a 5-0, 1.71 over his last six. The Rangers are starting righty Glenn Otto. They made a series of roster moves before the game, including calling up infield/outfield prospect Josh Smith and outfielder Zack Reks, placing infielder/outfielder Brad Miller (hip) on the injured list and designating for assignment reliever Albert Abreu. Also of note, Rays outfielder Brett Phillips turned 28 today.
