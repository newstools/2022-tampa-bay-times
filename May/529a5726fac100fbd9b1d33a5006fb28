Breaking Bad stars Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul surprised Tampa Bay fans Friday with stops at a couple local businesses. The pair, known best for their hit AMC show, are in Florida promoting their mezcal brand, Dos Hombres. Their visits drew throngs of people, some who happened on the events by accident. In Orlando, the stars popped by the Liquor Library & Wine Market and Bar Louie’s on Wednesday night, according to the Orlando Sentinel. In Dunedin on Friday morning, a line of fans stretched outside the store and snaked around the building and through the parking lot at Luekens Wine & Spirits, where Cranston and Paul were signing and handing out bottles of their signature booze. The pair arrived around 11 a.m. and left around 1:15 p.m. Luekens employee Jimmy Defrank said the store sold upwards of 900 bottles of Dos Hombres at the event, and guessed roughly 700 fans showed up to greet the stars and snag autographs. “They were just awesome,” Defrank said of the duo. “Just great.” Later on in the day, the pair surprised midday diners at American Social in Tampa, where throngs of bargoers packed the Harbour Island locale while Paul and Cranston played bartender, churning out dozens of cocktails. A signature drink was made for the event: Dos Hombres, Campari, Aperol, passion fruit, pineapple, lime juice and port wine. Bartender Devin Woodring said the bar will start selling the drink, which doesn’t have a name yet, in the near future. Ashley McCorkle, 28, was at American Social celebrating her friend’s bachelorette party when she said the stars showed up and surprised them. “They were overall just incredible,” McCorkle said. Cranston and Paul launched their mezcal brand in 2019. According to the company’s website, the spirit is the product of “multiple generations of proud Mezcal producers” from the village of San Luis del Rio, in Oaxaca, Mexico.
