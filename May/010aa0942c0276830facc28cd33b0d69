TAMPA — Police said Friday the two bodies found in a Tampa apartment Tuesday night belonged to a 22-year-old man and a 53-year-old man, and that they appeared to have died in a murder-suicide. Officers responded to the Mobley Park Apartments, 401 E 7th Ave., for a welfare check around 5 p.m. that evening, police said in a media release Tuesday. When Tampa officers arrived, they found two people dead. At the time, the agency said it was conducting a death investigation, but that it appeared to be an isolated event. On Wednesday, police sent out an updated release saying that the medical examiner’s office had not yet identified the men and investigators still were working to determine a cause of death. In a Friday afternoon media release, the department said the two men knew each other, and the deaths appeared to be a murder-suicide. Police did not release the names of the two men, their relationship to each other or their cause of death. Their deaths mark at least the eighth suspected murder-suicide involving people from the Tampa Bay area in 2022. The last apparent murder-suicide occurred about a month ago in Wesley Chapel, where a man was suspected of killing his brother and then himself, according to the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office.
