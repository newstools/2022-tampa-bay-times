Ardian Zika, R-Land O’ Lakes, who has spent four years in the state House representing Pasco County, announced Thursday that he will not seek a third term. “My family and I have concluded that seeking another term would not allow me to fully dedicate my time to my family and spend more time with my five young and growing children during these special chapters of their lives as they continue in their personal, academic and athletic journeys,” he said. Zika, a business consultant, called his time in the Legislature “the highest honor of my life” and he said, “As I am closing my first chapter in my journey of public service, I will not stop fighting to ensure Florida remains the launching pad for the American Dream.” An immigrant from Kosovo, Zika, 42, said he is celebrating 25 years in America in August and he feels grateful and blessed. He thanked his fellow legislators for support on key bills involving civic education curriculum, school bus safety, protections for consumers from pandemic-related fraud and funding for the BayCare Behavioral Health’s veterans intervention program. Zika had pre-filed to run for House District 55, where there are two other major party candidates, Democrat Tammy Garcia and Republican Gabriel Papadopoulos.
