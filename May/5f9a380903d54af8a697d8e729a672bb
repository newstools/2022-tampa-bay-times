ZooTampa is saluting the women and men in the United States armed forces with free admission this summer. Starting Wednesday and running through Sept. 1, all U.S. active-duty military, activated or drilling reservists and National Guard members are eligible to receive one-time complimentary admission to the zoo for themselves and up to three family members. The offer is only valid by going online and getting a unique promo code at zootampa.org/special-offers/military-salute. Meanwhile, the Blue Star Museums program, a partnership with the National Endowment for the Arts, has a lineup of museums across the country offering free admission to active-duty military personnel and up to five members of their family, including National Guard and Reserve. The 2022 Blue Star Museums program began on Armed Forces Day on May 21 and continues through Labor Day, on Sept. 5. Blue Star museums in the Tampa Bay area include the Florida Air Museum in Lakeland, the Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, St. Petersburg’s Imagine Museum, Great Explorations Children’s Museum and the Dalí Museum, as well as Tampa’s Museum of Art and the Henry Plant Museum. You can find a list of participating museums at arts.gov/bluestarmuseums. Visitors must show a military ID for entrance into a participating Blue Star Museum.
