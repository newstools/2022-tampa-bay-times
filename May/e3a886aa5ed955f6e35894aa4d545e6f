Manuel Margot, who has been one of the Rays’ top hitters, was activated from the injured list and will start in rightfield tonight against the Marlins at Tropicana Field. Margot has been sidelined with a right hamstring strain. He was first hurt May 9, the same day he was honored as the American League Player of the Week. At the time, he was hitting .348 with three homers, 21 RBI and a .912 OPS. He tried to come back after resting for a few days, then was placed on the injured list on May 15. He played in extended spring training games on Monday and Tuesday and was said to be feeling good. The Rays also have Yandy Diaz back in the lineup, as he has been out since leaving Saturday night’s game with a strained left shoulder. Reliever Dusten Knight, who was called up Sunday from Triple-A Durham, was optioned back, having pitched twice, allowing only one unearned run. The Rays could have opted to keep the bullpen fully staffed and instead sent down an infielder, with either Isaac Paredes or Vidal Brujan an option. Drew Rasmussen, who has been one of the Rays’ top starters since moving into the rotation last August, will be on the mound tonight. Cody Poteet will be the starter for the Marlins.
