The bodies of three people were discovered at a Riverview home Wednesday morning, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office. It happened in the 13000 block of Graham Yarden Drive, the agency said in a news release. The deaths are being investigated as an “apparent double murder-suicide,” deputies said. Sheriff Chad Chronister will provide additional details at a news conference later Wednesday afternoon. The three deaths Wednesday mark at least the ninth suspected murder-suicide involving people from the Tampa Bay area this year. Need help?
