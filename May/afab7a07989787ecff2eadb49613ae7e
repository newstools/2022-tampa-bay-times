The University of North Florida’s next president is a familiar name to many in Tampa Bay — Moez Limayem, dean of the University of South Florida’s Muma College of Business. The selection was announced Monday by UNF’s board of trustees and is subject to confirmation by the state Board of Governors in June. Limayem will become the university’s seventh president. Limayem has been dean of the USF business college since 2012 and was praised by UNF officials for having raised more than $126 million and cultivating relationships with prominent community donors. “I’m humbled and very honored, but also I know I will miss my colleagues and friends here at USF and in the community,” Limayem said in an interview. Limayem said he has high hopes for the future of USF as a resource in the region’s expanding business community, with more partnerships and improved student outcomes. “We are becoming a magnet for employers to come and recruit our students,” he said. “We are also showing great return on investment for incredible transformational gifts we have received.” Kevin Hyde, chair of the UNF board of trustees, called Limayem an “innovative and accomplished leader” in a statement announcing the board’s pick among four finalists. “As we celebrate UNF’s 50th year, we look forward to Dr. Limayem using his experience, leadership and engaging style to continue to build on our strong history, growing opportunities for students and enhancing the university’s critical role in the region and beyond,” he said. Limayem said he was excited to join a community he’s already found welcoming. If he is confirmed, Limayem will begin in August. A UNF spokesperson said the board has begun discussions about terms of his contract. In a message to the USF community, USF president Rhea Law congratulated Limayem and said the university would conduct a national search to find the next dean.
