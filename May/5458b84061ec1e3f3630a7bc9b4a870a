Grammy darlings and country staples Lady A will headline Tampa’s annual Pig Jig, a barbecue contest for a good cause. Platinum-selling artist Kip Moore will add more sauce to the mix, event organizers announced Monday. Alternative artists X Ambassadors, Bahamas and Jarrod Morris are also on the bill for the Oct. 22 event at Julian B. Lane Park in Tampa. Tickets go on sale 10 a.m. Friday and start at $75 for general admission at tampapigjig.com. A new VIP option, called the Watering Hole, offers an exclusive shaded tent area for $175 that includes four drinks, a meal of choice from the event’s vendors, private bathrooms and tent access. Last year’s Tampa Pig Jig, which featured country superstar Darius Rucker, set a record for the  fastest sellout in the event’s 10-year history. They continue the A-list music trend by landing Lady A, a trio that has amassed record-breaking success with seven Grammys and 10 hits that were No. 1 on the Billboard charts. Made up of Charles Kelley, Dave Haywood and Hillary Scott, the group’s crossover hit Need You Now won the 2011 Grammy award for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Moore made his way into the mainstream in 2012 with double-platinum album Up All Night, considered one of the most commercially successful debuts for a male country artist. His chart toppers include Somethin’ ‘Bout a Truck, Hey Pretty Girl and Beer Money. The event, which was started by a group of Tampa men in support of a friend with a rare kidney disease, has grown into one of the area’s favorite days for music and barbecue. It has also raised more than $5 million for NephCure Kidney International, a program in need of funds for research into a debilitating kidney disease.
