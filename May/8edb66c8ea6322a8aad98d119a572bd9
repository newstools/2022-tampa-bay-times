CLEARWATER — A Clearwater man has been arrested on a manslaughter charge after police said he fatally stabbed his daughter while fighting with her boyfriend Sunday evening. Sidney Green, 22, was the woman stabbed by her father, according to the Clearwater Police Department. She was trying to get between her father, 51-year-old Laurence Green, and her boyfriend as they fought at the Bay Cove Apartments complex at 19135 U.S. 19 N. Officers responded to the complex about 7 p.m. and Sidney Green was taken to Morton Plant Hospital, where she later died. Laurence Green was booked into the Pinellas County Jail early Monday morning. Bail information was not yet available on Monday. A Facebook account for Laurence Green remained public on Monday. There, he frequently posted about his daughters, including Sidney. In a birthday post on Feb. 19, he wrote in part: “For the last 22 years of my life you have been my energy, my fire, my challenge, my anger, my resolve, my heart, my fury, my love, my baby girl, my daughter.” Sidney Green replied in the comments that she loved him. Police did not say whether Sidney Green’s boyfriend was injured in the fight. His name was not released.
