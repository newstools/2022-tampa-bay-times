Frontier Airlines is expanding its international connections out of Tampa. The low-budget carrier is launching three new international routes out of Tampa International Airport to Punta Cana and Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic and Jamaica’s Montego Bay, the airport announced Tuesday. Frontier is also adding a domestic flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico. The routes will begin service in June and July, according to airport officials. The airport has slowly added more international routes over the last year — like Panama City, Havana, London, Cancun, Nassau, Grand Cayman, Frankfurt, Zurich and several cities in Canada — after the pandemic halted nearly all travel in and out of the country. The flights to Jamaica and the Dominican Republic will be the first new international flights that weren’t in service at the airport before the pandemic, Tampa airport officials said. “Frontier has been an important part of (the Tampa airport’s) recovery and growth over the past year and we’re excited to now see this partnership expand into international service for our passengers,” Tampa International Airport CEO Joe Lopano said in a statement. “We expect these flights to be extremely popular here.” Flights to San Juan will operate daily (starting June 23), to Santo Domingo (June 30) and Montego Bay (June 24) twice a week, and Punta Cana once a week (July 2). Frontier has grown its presence in Tampa ever since it established a crew base here last May. The company said it plans to hire 250 flight attendants and 140 pilots. Frontier is still in the running to buy the low-budget competitor Spirit Airlines. Earlier this week Spirit officials rejected a deal with JetBlue in favor of Frontier, citing that Frontier’s offer was more lucrative.
