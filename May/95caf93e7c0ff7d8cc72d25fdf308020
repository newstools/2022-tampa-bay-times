Construction has begun on a 31-story luxury apartment tower in downtown Tampa, Coastal Construction announced on Thursday. The Arts and Entertainment Residences, developed by American Land Ventures and Gazit Horizons, is building a 334-unit skyscraper across from the Straz Center for the Performing Arts, according to a media release. “There is no other location like this in Tampa, where in 60 seconds, you’re stepping into one of three cultural institutions, taking a stroll on the Riverwalk, or soaking in the view from your own open balcony,” said Granvil Tracy, President of American Land Ventures in a statement. “The River Arts District is thriving, and we’re thrilled that AER in the Arts District will be the next step in that growth.” The project has been more than a decade in the making, with arts and local government officials weighing in on the details of the development over the years. The apartment tower will offer shops at the street level with 13,688 square feet of retail space and 514 parking spaces in a garage above the storefronts. The project is situated between many of downtown Tampa’s art and tourism destinations, from the Straz Center to Tampa Museum of Art, Glazer Children’s Museum, Tampa Riverwalk and Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park. “You’ll notice the units are larger, and we’ve placed an emphasis on a healthy lifestyle and wellness, all of which offer a wide appeal from professional millennials to baby boomers,” said Sean DeMartino, the general contractor on the project, in a statement. The building will offer studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom floor plans. Construction is expected to be completed by the spring of 2024. Coastal Construction is one of the largest general contractors in the Southeast with offices in Miami, Orlando, Tampa and West Palm Beach.
