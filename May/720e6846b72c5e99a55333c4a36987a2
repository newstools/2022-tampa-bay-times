Two teens from Wesley Chapel were killed late Monday after the sport utility vehicle they were in crashed into a retention pond and sank, the Florida Highway Patrol reported. The teens killed — a 17-year-old boy who was driving, and a 17-year-old girl who was a passenger — are from Wesley Chapel, according to a news release from the Highway Patrol. Troopers said the crash occurred about 10:30 p.m. at Estancia Boulevard and San Romano Drive. The driver was heading north on Estancia when for an “unknown reason” he lost control of the SUV, troopers said. “The vehicle entered a retention pond and submerged completely,” the Highway Patrol’s news release states. The Pasco Sheriff’s Office’s dive team responded and located the vehicle several hours later. Both teens were dead inside, troopers said. The news release noted that both teens were wearing seat belts. Troopers did not release the names of the teens or any other details. Community members said in social media posts they are planning to hold a candlelight vigil and prayer circle at 8 p.m. Tuesday at the retention pond in honor of the two teens.
