NAPA, Calif. — Paul Pelosi, the 82-year-old husband of U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, was arrested this weekend on suspicion of DUI in Northern California, police records showed Sunday. Paul Pelosi was taken into custody late Saturday in Napa County north of San Francisco, according to a sheriff’s office online booking report. He could face charges including driving under the influence and driving with a blood alcohol content level of 0.08 or higher, the report said. Pelosi’s bail was set for $5,000 for the two misdemeanors, records showed. No other details were immediately available.
