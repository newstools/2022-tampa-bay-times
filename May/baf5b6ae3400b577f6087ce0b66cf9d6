University of South Florida president Rhea Law has named her selection for the new regional chancellor of the St. Petersburg campus: Christian Hardigree, founding dean of the School of Hospitality at Metropolitan State University of Denver. The selection was made after Hardigree and two other candidates, including former St. Petersburg deputy mayor Kanika Tomalin, participated in town hall forums and community members provided the president with feedback. Hardigree was commended by business leaders on the search committee for innovative ideas, such as faculty internships and partnering with businesses. “We are thrilled to welcome Christian Hardigree, a leader who brings a demonstrated history of academic and administrative experience, as well as an excellent record of serving the communities she has been a part of throughout her career,” Law said in a statement announcing the selection. “I am confident she will be an outstanding advocate for the St. Petersburg campus and a trusted partner to me as we work together to continue the University of South Florida’s tremendous momentum.” During her town hall session, Hardigree said she wanted to be a part of USF after visiting. “I absolutely fell in love with the faculty, staff, students and community members I met at USF St. Petersburg,” Hardigree said in a statement Wednesday. “It’s clearly a special place, and I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to lead such a vibrant campus. I can’t wait to get started and am honored by the confidence that President Law and other members of the USF leadership team are showing in me.” Hardigree, who replaces outgoing regional chancellor Martin Tadlock, will begin July 1. This is a developing story and will be updated.
