Tampa’s Bloomin’ Brands is plotting a restaurant switcheroo near International Plaza. The parent company of Outback Steakhouse is planning to replace its Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar at 4322 W Boy Scout Blvd. with another of its brands, Bonefish Grill. Fleming’s will move and reopen next door on the vacant site once occupied by Hawaiian restaurant Roy’s at 4342 W Boy Scout Blvd. A Bloomin’ Brands spokesperson said the new Fleming’s is scheduled to open in summer 2023, at which point the current Fleming’s will be converted to a Bonefish Grill. The proposed new Fleming’s will be 11,080 square feet and seat 296, according to plans filed with the city. It will have a 1,770-square-foot convertible patio space and a 1,210-square-foot courtyard. “It’ll be jaw-dropping,” Bloomin’ Brands CEO David Deno said of the new Fleming’s. The changes would give three of Bloomin’ Brands’ four core brands — Outback, Fleming’s and Bonefish Grill — a home just down the road from the company’s corporate headquarters, near the entrance to International Plaza. “We want to be a very strong citizen of this marketplace in many ways,” Deno said. “We certainly believe in Tampa-St. Pete. We put our money here, and in Florida overall.”
