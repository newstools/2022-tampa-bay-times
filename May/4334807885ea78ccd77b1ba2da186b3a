ST. PETERSBURG — In this battle of Tampa Bay vs. Toronto, the Rays will send lefty Ryan Yarbrough to the mound looking to continue his success against the Blue Jays, with first pitch at 6:10 p.m. on Star Wars Night. Yarbrough, the crafty lefty, is 8-2, 3.23 in 17 career appearances (eight starts) against the Jays, including 5-0, 2.42 in nine games (four starts) at the Trop, though his numbers have not been as good the past two seasons. The Rays are looking to make it two straight over the Jays, who are on a season-high five-game losing streak and are without centerfielder George Springer, who sprained his left ankle in Friday’s game. Second baseman Brandon Lowe was scratched from the Rays lineup about 2½ hours before Saturday’s first pitch, though the team said he was healthy and just getting a rest. Taylor Walls replaced him.
