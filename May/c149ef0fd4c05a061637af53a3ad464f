A downtown Tampa apartment tower has sold for $184 million — just two years after it sold for $120 million. The Nine15 apartments at 915 Franklin St. sold on May 6 to a limited liability corporation owned by investment giants Goldman Sachs. The previous ownership group, South Carolina real estate investors Blaze Capital Partners, bought the place in 2020. The 23-story, 362-unit building opened in 2017 and has studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments starting at 572 square feet. It’s the fifth time an Hillsborough County apartment complex has sold for more than $100 million this year. Most recently, the Manor Riverwalk apartments at 202 S Parker St. sold for $225 million in late 2021. Residents were informed of the purchase through a letter dated May 6.
