WESLEY CHAPEL — To place the Interstate 75, State Road 56 interchange into the new diverging diamond traffic pattern, State Road 56 will be closed to all traffic at Interstate 75 on April 1. The closure will begin at 11 p.m. on Friday and will continue until some point in the daylight hours of April 3. During that period, no traffic will be allowed to travel through the work zone across Interstate 75. Traffic on State Road 56 will be detoured using State Road 56, Bruce B. Downs Boulevard and State Road 54/56, Wesley Chapel Boulevard. When the traffic pattern re-opens on April 3 in the diverging diamond configuration, it will not be at full capacity until closer to project completion this summer. The contractor will still have additional work to do to open an additional through-lane on both eastbound and westbound SR 56 and an additional turn lane from the northbound exit ramp onto westbound State Road 56. During the closure, two ramps will be available to use at the Interstate 75 and State Road 56 interchange: the eastbound State Road 56 entrance ramp onto southbound Interstate 75 and the northbound Interstate 275/75 exit ramps onto eastbound State Road 56. All other traffic wishing to use the interchange will be directed via detour signage to use the Interstate 75 interchange at State Road 54/County Road 54.
