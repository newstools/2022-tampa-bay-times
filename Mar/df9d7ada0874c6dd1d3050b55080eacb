PORT CHARLOTTE — Rays infielder Taylor Walls has sided with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on the controversial topic of whether to allow transgender athletes to compete in girls’ and women’s sports. DeSantis interjected himself into the issue Tuesday with comments, a proclamation and a tweet, criticizing the NCAA for “destroying opportunities for women, making a mockery of its championships and perpetuating a fraud” after transgender woman Lia Thomas won an event at the national swim meet. Walls aligned himself with DeSantis early Wednesday by sharing the governor’s tweet and adding, “Couldn’t agree more.” Walls, a second-year big-leaguer from Georgia who attended Florida State, is believed to be one of the first professional athletes to speak out on the subject. His views are not likely to go over well with his bosses, as the Rays front office is very openly supportive of inclusiveness, especially with respect to racial and gender issues. Walls was not available for comment during the morning clubhouse media access but is slated to play in today’s exhibition game against the Braves in North Port. Rays manager Kevin Cash said there would be further conversations on the topic. “There are a lot of challenging discussions in our society right now,” Cash said. “It’s probably best that we take the time to have more discussions to find clarity in fairness to everybody. Twitter is not the best forum for that.” Speaking Tuesday in Wesley Chapel, DeSantis unexpectedly brought up the issue, claiming that Sarasota native Emma Weyant, who finished second to Thomas in the 500-yard women’s freestyle race, should be recognized as the “best female swimmer” in the event. • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
