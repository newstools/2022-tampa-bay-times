Royal Caribbean debuted its latest, and largest, ship for its maiden voyage from Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale on Friday: Wonder of the Seas. The French-built ship is the world’s largest cruise ship, after Royal Caribbean’s Symphony of the Seas. Wonder of the Seas has room for 6,988 passengers and 2,300 crew members. It weighs almost 240,000 tons. The Miami Herald was denied access Friday to a media tour of the new ship. Royal Caribbean’s website says the ship is 1,118 feet long and 210 feet wide. Its 18 decks hold 2,867 staterooms, rock climbing walls, waterslides, a carousel, laser tag, a mini golf course, an arcade, an outdoor movie theater and a zipline. The mega ship has nine complimentary restaurants, 11 specialty restaurants and 11 bars and lounges. The ship is the newest in Royal Caribbean’s Oasis class of ships. The five ships in the Oasis class are the five largest cruise ships in the world — part of former CEO Richard Fain’s vision to create floating mega-resorts.
