The two were westbound for California and spent Saturday night in Mississippi, Capt. Paul Burch of the Mobile County Sheriff’s Office told WALA-TV. They got up early Sunday and headed off in the wrong direction, resulting in an argument that ended with Hernandez getting out of the vehicle with his belongings just a few miles into Alabama. “She drove away.

Evidence from the vehicle’s computer system showed it was traveling at 73 mph upon impact, he said. Uninjured in the crash, Suarez was jailed without bond and doesn’t have have a lawyer who could speak on her behalf. Court records show she has a criminal history that includes domestic violence charges.
