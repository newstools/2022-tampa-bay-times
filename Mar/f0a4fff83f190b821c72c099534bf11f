Show your work UF: No pressure over data | March 17 Once in ninth-grade algebra, my teacher was stalking the aisles during a test and stopped at my side. She looked at my problem and the sum, and said “I don’t know how you got there, but the answer is correct.” Frankly, I didn’t know how I’d gotten there either. This article reminded me of that. Even if state officials didn’t pressure researchers to misuse or destroy state health data paid for by the taxpayers, the investigation was warranted based on grim recent history, and frankly the outcome of this investigation is still ... suspicious.

The public and journalists need to remain vigilant until the current cabal in the governor’s mansion and the Board of Trustees is long gone. Steve Douglas, St. Petersburg Watch their words ‘Don’t say gay’ brought me back to Anita Bryant and 1977 | Perspective, March 20 Russian President Vladimir Putin: Don’t say “war.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis: Don’t say “gay.” Watch for outlandish legislative initiatives that restrain democracy, are unfair to or negatively portray select groups of people, and for any behavior that just makes you uncomfortable. Be careful for whom you vote. We have to elect better people. Rick Soskis, Havana, Fla. No appeasement Zelenskyy’s brilliant speech should impel Biden and Congress to protect Ukrainian skies | Column, March 18 NATO’s current policy toward the unprovoked Russian invasion and destruction of Ukraine comes down to this: If a tyrant has nuclear weapons, we have to appease him and not confront him directly. It is the wrong policy as Vladimir Putin will not stop his aggression until he is defeated. The Ukrainians, brave as they are, need air power now, not when it is too late. Taiwan will soon be the next democracy to be attacked, this time by China, if NATO continues down the appeasement road. Susie Hoeller, Lutz
