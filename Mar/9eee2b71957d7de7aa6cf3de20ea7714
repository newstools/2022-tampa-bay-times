Harry Bosch fans, mark your calendars. Bosch: Legacy, the spinoff from the hit series Bosch, starts streaming May 6. Both series are based on the megabestselling novels about Los Angeles detective Harry Bosch written by part-time Tampa resident Michael Connelly. The first series was a seven-season hit on Amazon Prime, following Bosch through gritty cases as an LAPD detective. Bosch: Legacy finds Harry retired, but still working as a private detective. It will air on IMDb TV, a free, ad-supported streaming service, and on Amazon Prime starting May 6. Key cast members will return: Titus Welliver as Harry; Madison Lintz as Maddie Bosch, Harry’s daughter, now a rookie cop; and Mimi Rogers as Honey Chandler, a high-powered defense attorney and Harry’s sometime nemesis. Other Bosch cast members may appear as well. You can watch the trailer for Bosch: Legacy here.
