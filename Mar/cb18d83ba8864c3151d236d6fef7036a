BOSTON ― The status of Lightning defenseman Ryan McDonagh was uncertain Thursday night after he left Tampa Bay’s 3-2 loss to Boston in the third period after blocking a shot. McDonagh blocked defenseman Brandon Carlo’s wrist shot from the slot with 6:02 remaining in the period. He skated off the ice and immediately went down the tunnel. He returned briefly for a 24-second shift, but that was his only ice time in the final 13:58 of the game. Coach Jon Cooper said after the game the team was waiting to learn more about the injury but “it didn’t look good.” McDonagh had a team-high six blocked shots in the loss and leads the Lightning with 116. McDonagh wasn’t the only Lightning player to get nicked up in the loss. Center Brayden Point skated off gingerly after a puck battle against the boards midway through the second period, but he returned for his next shift and finished the game. Defenseman Victor Hedman hit the boards hard in the third period and was favoring his left leg just before David Pastrnak scored his second of three goals. Hedman also finished the game. • • • The Tampa Bay Times has commemorated the Lightning’s second consecutive Stanley Cup title with a new hardcover coffee table book, Striking Twice. Order now.
