TAMPA — Working in the literal shadow of an indoor practice facility under construction, USF formally kicked off spring drills Tuesday with a possible record turnout. The spring roster issued to reporters featured 114 names, two more than third-year coach Jeff Scott indicated would be available for the 15-practice session. Division I-A teams are allowed 120 players each year. “That’s a big advantage,” Scott said last week. Among the group are 18 Power Five transfers and 12 “super seniors” afforded an extra year of NCAA eligibility due to the pandemic. All 12 finished in the top 25 of the program’s “grit” rankings (based on overall effort) during the seven-week winter workout program, Scott said. “That was one thing I was interested in kind of watching, because we have some really talented transfers coming in from different places that are older guys,” Scott added. “We’ve got a lot of returners trying to figure out the depth chart and all those things. And man, our team has welcomed (the transfers) with open arms.” The Bulls will have 14 closed spring workouts before holding their annual spring intrasquad game April 9 at 6 p.m. at Raymond James Stadium.
