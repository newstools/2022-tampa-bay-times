A new event is coming to Spa Beach at the St. Pete Pier. Called Jubilation, it’s a ‘70s, ‘80s and ‘90s tea dance with a DJ, live performances and lights and lasers lighting up the scene. Tea dances played an important part in LGBTQ history. It was illegal in the 1960s for bars in New York to sell alcohol at gay-centered parties, and police would conduct raids on establishments catering to them. So they held tea dances in places like Fire Island modeled after the old English garden parties. The gay community of New York, and later across the country, began hosting Sunday high tea at 4 p.m., and bars would begin by serving tea and crumpets rather than alcohol to be on the right side of the law. The St. Pete Pier event is a fundraiser for Metro Inclusive Health, for LGBTQ health care providers, and the Tunnels To Towers Org that supports first responders and catastrophically injured veterans. The event is taking place April 24 at 5 p.m., which is “the typical time for an ‘80s tea dance,” organizers said. It will feature renowned DJ Sam Gee, lights, lasers, video screens and a performance by Robert Brown, the Irish-born former lead singer of the gay dance band Bearforce 1 that was a big hit on UK’s Got Talent. Tickets are $30 at the door, but you can get them online for $25 in advance at jubilationstpete.com. If you go Jubilation, the tea dance with music from the ‘70s, ‘80s and ‘90s, is also a fundraiser.
