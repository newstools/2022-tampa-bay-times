A major Indianapolis digital marketing company is plotting a national expansion that includes an office with more than 100 employees in downtown St. Petersburg. TrendyMinds, whose clients have ranged from Humana and Salesforce to Lids and the Indiana Pacers, picked St. Petersburg and San Antonio, Texas, for two regional hubs that will open this year. The company announced its entry into the market last fall and has about 16 employees working remotely in Tampa Bay, but founder Trevor Yager is actively looking for space to house many more. “As our business and clientele grows, we are looking to expand our footprint,” Yager said in a statement. “With the company’s emphasis on healthcare and technology, Tampa Bay’s strong healthcare reputation and budding tech scene were the perfect fit. Additionally, TrendyMinds is planning for continued rapid growth, and Tampa Bay provides a growing and diverse talent pool as we look to expand our capabilities.” The announcement comes on the heels of a private equity investment — unspecified in size, but described as an “eight-figure” sum — from San Antonio-based firm Contour Ridge, which will allow TrendyMinds to add at least 600 positions nationwide. In St. Petersburg, the company has already posted jobs for copywriters, web and email marketing specialists and a head of talent. Nearly two-thirds of TrendyMinds’ marketing work is in health care, pharmaceutical and technology, though it also works in other sectors. The firm has won national awards for its digital work for Eli Lilly and Co., Indiana University Health and Indianapolis International Airport. Other clients have included Drift, Cummins and Indiana Sports Corp for the 2021 NCAA Men’s Basketball Final Four.
