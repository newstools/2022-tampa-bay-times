We’ve all heard some version of the apocryphal quote that “war is God’s way of teaching Americans geography.” It’s not really funny, but it’s also not wrong. Where is Kyiv? How big is Ukraine? What nations border it? As the war grinds on, here are some maps that will help you locate key cities and sites. We’ve superimposed a map of Florida onto Ukraine to give you some context. For example, it’s about a 400-mile drive from Kyiv to the Polish border, a little less than the distance from Tampa to Key West. Download a printable PDF of the map here. The lines on the big Ukraine map show its major roads. Meantime, here are a few comparisons. Ukraine is about 4.3 times bigger in area than Florida. Ukraine has about 44 million people to Florida’s 22 million. Kyiv, the capital, has just under 3 million people, a shade smaller than the Tampa Bay area. And that infamous 40-mile-long Russian convoy of tanks, trucks and armored vehicles? It apparently is still 15 miles away from Kyiv, snaking along the west side of the Dnieper River to the northwest of Kyiv.
