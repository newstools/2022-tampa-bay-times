In projects ranging from the Florida Keys to the Panhandle, Gov. Ron DeSantis and the state Cabinet on Tuesday approved a series of land deals to help shield more than 17,000 acres from potential development. The deals include spending $10.6 million to purchase a conservation easement from Lykes Bros Inc. on 6,864 acres in the Fisheating Creek ecosystem in Glades County. The Nature Conservancy touted the project, which it said will help create a wildlife corridor and protect water supplies. “This conservation easement connects protected habitat from south of the Caloosahatchee River to Fisheating Creek, securing the wildlife corridor for Florida panther migration north toward protected lands flanking Fisheating Creek,” The Nature Conservancy said on its website. Conservation easements generally limit development but allow continued use of land for such things as agriculture. In all, the projects approved Tuesday total nearly $40 million. They range from 2.85 acres of hardwood hammocks in the Keys to a 3,610-acre parcel in the Wolfe Creek Forest in the Panhandle.
