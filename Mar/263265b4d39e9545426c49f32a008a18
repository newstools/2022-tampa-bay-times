Florida tight end Gage Wilcox has sustained what is expected to be a career-ending injury, Gators coach Billy Napier told reporters Thursday night. “Very unfortunate for Gage,” Napier said after a spring scrimmage. “While he was here with us, he did a fantastic job. Certainly tough but part of the game.” Napier did not elaborate on the nature of Wilcox’s injury. Wilcox signed with UF in the 2021 class as a four-star recruit from Jefferson High and one of the top 12 tight ends in the country. The 6-foot-4, 241-pound athlete debuted last season against USF and also played in the Gasparilla Bowl against UCF. His injury is a significant blow to an already thin position group. Another Tampa product, Jesuit High alumnus Jonathan Odom is sidelined after undergoing a recent surgery. In need of bodies, the Gators have moved Dante Zanders from defensive end to tight end. Napier said Zanders “has been a godsend” and has the potential to make an impact at his new position this season. Another defensive lineman, Griffin McDowell, has been playing tight end and caught a passing during Thursday’s scrimmage. So did one of UF’s long snappers. “When a long snapper catches a pass, you’re being creative to find a way to get it done,” Napier said. UF has some incoming players at the position who will have a chance to help, including King High alumnus Tony Livingston. But expect the Gators to be active in the transfer portal after spring at tight end and elsewhere. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
