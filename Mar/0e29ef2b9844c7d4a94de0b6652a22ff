A SWAT standoff in Pinellas Park ended after an armed man who was holding a woman and two children hostage in an apartment released them before shooting himself, police said Wednesday. Authorities identified the man as 37-year-old Lee Michael Thrall in a news release Wednesday night. Police said they were summoned to the 4500 block of 76th Avenue about 10:10 a.m. after someone called 911 and hung up, according to a Pinellas Park Police Department news release. Officers who were in the area heard gunshots and loud screaming, according to an earlier release. As officers approached the front door of the residence, a shot was fired from within the apartment, according to the release. The bullet struck a vehicle near the front door. Police evacuated surrounding apartments and they urged people to avoid the area of 45th Street and 76th Avenue, the news release said. Officers determined that the hostages were a woman and two juvenile girls. Around noon, Thrall released the two girls, police said. Officers continued negotiations, and the woman was released around 3:19 p.m. All three hostages were uninjured. Police continued negotiating with Thrall until about 4:05 p.m., when they tried to enter the apartment. They heard multiple gunshots, went inside and found Thrall dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to the release. The investigation is ongoing, police said. Need help?
