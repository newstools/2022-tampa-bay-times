Zimmermann, an Australian fashion label, is opening a store at Hyde Park Village in Tampa. The store will be Zimmermann’s first on Florida’s Gulf Coast and is set to open this summer at 1620 W. Snow Ave., according to WS Development, the firm which owns and manages the retail center. It will be located next to beach clothing store Sunni Spencer. Zimmermann was founded in 1991 in Sydney by sisters Nicky and Simone Zimmermann and focuses on “sophisticated femininity” for luxury swimwear and resort clothing. It has since grown an international following. The company has a handful of European stores in San Tropez, Paris, London and Milan and has expanded to 14 stores across the U.S. in New York City, Las Vegas, Palm Beach and Miami, among other locations. The first U.S. store opened in 2011 in Beverly Hills. Hyde Park Village has been bustling with activity during the pandemic. The South Tampa shopping destination has seen a wave of recent store and dining openings include Sephora, a Kittenish boutique, quirky scoop shop OddFellows Ice Cream Co. and a Nike Live concept store. More are expected to come later this year.
