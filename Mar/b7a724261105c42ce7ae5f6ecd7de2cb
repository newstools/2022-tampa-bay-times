First, Paulina Gervasi’s croissants and sweets drew long lines at local popups and St. Petersburg’s Saturday Morning Market. Then her business, Le Clementine Bakeshop, gained a semi-permanent home at Pete’s Bagels in 2021. Now, the baker is spearheading a new concept at the Museum of Fine Arts, St. Petersburg: Café Clementine. The artisanal bakery and casual eatery is set to open April 30. The main cafe counter will be located in MFA’s conservatory — but you won’t need a museum ticket to savor the scratch-made pastries. According to an announcement, the cafe will focus on “fresh, wholesome dishes and traditionally made Viennoiserie inspired by the seasons and with thoughtfully sourced ingredients.” There will be a rotating all-day brunch menu, a variety of beverages and pastries baked fresh every morning Thursday through Sunday. The majority of the ingredients used will be locally produced or organic. Diners can bask in the sunny indoor sanctuary, or eat on the outdoor terrace with a view of the North Yacht Basin. Reservations won’t be available, but the cafe is ready to package to-go orders that can be enjoyed at the nearby waterfront parks if it gets crowded. “We aim to create a warm and inviting space for our ever-supportive community to gather and where we, alongside our team, explore artistic expression through food,” wrote @leclementinebakeshop on Instagram. “Whether it is a stop along your morning walk on the waterfront, a light snack after a day perusing the galleries, or a sweet afternoon pick-me-up, Café Clementine is a place that welcomes any and all.”
