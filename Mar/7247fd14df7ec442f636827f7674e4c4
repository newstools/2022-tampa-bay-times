TAMPA — Hillsborough Sheriff Chad Chronister helped remove a Plant City family from a boat taking on water during the Tampa Bay AirFest on Sunday afternoon, the Sheriff’s Office said. Eleven people were pulled from the boat, a 32-foot Sea Ray Sundancer, which began taking on water around 3:30 p.m. near the Davis Island Yacht Club, deputies say. The evacuation happened during the flight of the U.S. Navy Blue Angels at the end of the Sunday show. Chronister was working with the Sheriff’s Office’s Marine Unit. Officers from Tampa police and the U.S. Coast Guard also helped in the removal. A number of people watched the airshow Saturday and Sunday from boats in the waters surrounding MacDill Air Force Base. Deputies said the boat began taking on water shortly after it launched and lost power. Photos and a five-minute video released by the Sheriff’s Office show children aboard the vessel. One woman who was helped from the boat, in an interview with the Sheriff’s Office from shore, said they were trying to reach an island when the boat’s inboard motor shut down. The woman, who was not named by the Sheriff’s Office, said the lights went off, the boat started to take on water and the children began crying. The video shows a smaller boat towing the SeaRay through the water.
