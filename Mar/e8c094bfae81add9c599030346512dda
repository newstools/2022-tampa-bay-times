Longtime Tampa Bay residents and newcomers alike have even more to look forward to this spring along downtown St. Petersburg’s sparkling waterfront. After a two-year hiatus because of the pandemic, Mainsail Art Festival will return to Vinoy Park on April 16-17. Now in its 47th year, the festival showcases fine art, entertainment and children’s activities, live music and food vendors. Aside from its name, poster art and the boats that will surely be cruising around Tampa Bay along Vinoy Park, the festival doesn’t have to do with sailing. According to the festival’s website, the original name was shortened to Mainsail in 1977 “to convey the event’s importance, its excitement and marina setting,” which at that time was South Straub Park. The festival is ranked at No. 14 in Sunshine Artist magazine’s 200 Best festivals in the Fine Art and Design category. The magazine is a national art show and festival guide. Because of the effect the pandemic had on festivals, the magazine made the rankings, which are determined by revenue, based on the past decade. $60,000 in prize money will be awarded in the juried show. The festival typically draws more than 100,000 visitors over the weekend. Mainsail Art Festival is free to attend, with no ticket required. The event will be cashless this year.
