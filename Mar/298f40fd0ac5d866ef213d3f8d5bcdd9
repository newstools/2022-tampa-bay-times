TAMPA ― Receivers are greedy by nature. They demand the ball and are generally regarded as the divas of the NFL. Then there is Mike Evans. The Bucs Pro Bowler has a NFL record eight consecutive seasons with at least 1,000 yards receiving and is on a career path that could wind up at the Pro Football Hall of Fame. But Evans is an unselfish player, on and off the field. He has sacrificed statistics for a chance to win, willfully sharing the football with Chris Godwin, Rob Gronkowski and Antonio Brown in order to win 29 games and a Super Bowl the past two seasons. He also gives back with the Mike Evans Family Foundation established with wife Ashli in December 2017. The foundation focuses on empowering youth, encouraging education and taking a stand against domestic violence. Four times, Evans has allowed the Bucs to restructure his contract in order to create more salary cap space to sign free agents. It doesn’t cost Evans money because the Bucs merely convert his base salary into a bonus, but it raises the amount of dead money on his contract for future years. Bucs fans were so appreciative of Evans’ unselfishness that they started giving back. In an organic gesture, fans began making $13 donations to the foundation to match Evans’ jersey number. The movement has raised more than $40,000 in just a few days. “Thank you Bucs fans!” Evans responded on his foundation website. “You’ve always been supportive of me and my family during our time in Tampa and we appreciate you. Now you all have come out and supported our foundation in a big way. And we will make sure that it’s all put to good use in the community.” • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
