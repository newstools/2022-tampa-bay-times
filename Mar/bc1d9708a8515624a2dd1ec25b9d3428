The developers behind Water Street Tampa are planning a giant Yard House bar and restaurant directly across the street from Amalie Arena. Plans filed last week with the city show a detailed proposal for a 16,400-square-foot building at 450 Channelside Drive, on the northwest corner of Channelside Drive and Nebraska Avenue — the block that formerly housed Ferg’s Live. Yard House is part of the Orlando-based Darden family of restaurant brands, which also includes Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, the Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze and Eddie V’s Prime Seafood, among others. There are more than 80 Yard House restaurants across North America, the nearest of which is in Orlando. Renderings show a mostly brick-wrapped building lined with trees and space for murals, featuring indoor-outdoor seating with oversized games on a patio. Yard House’s big selling point is its craft beer selection, which can boast upwards of 100 beers on tap. But it also has a hefty menu offering everything from burgers and tacos to poke salads and “Nashville hot chicken and pancakes.” Water Street Tampa — the $3.5 billion downtown makeover from Strategic Property Partners, a joint venture between Lightning owner Jeff Vinik and Bill Gates’ Cascade Investment — is nearing the end of its first phase of development, which, when complete, will include nearly 1,300 residences, two full-scale hotels and a 375,000-square-foot office tower. This year, Strategic Property Partners is likely to reveal more details about its second phase, which is expected to include more residences and commercial space on the land formerly occupied by the old Ardent Mills flour mill. Yard House will join an array of new restaurants announced for Water Street Tampa, including the just-opened Naked Farmer and the upcoming Wagamama, 3 Corners and the Pearl.
