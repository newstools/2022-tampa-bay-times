ST. PETERSBURG — Firefighters attacked a fire from inside at Tsunami Japanese Steakhouse on Friday morning before pulling back to contain the flames, according to St. Petersburg Fire Rescue. Tactics were switched to protect firefighters after they couldn’t reach a section of the fire in the building at 2176 Tyrone Blvd. N in the Crossroads Shopping Center, the agency said in a news release at 7:17 a.m. Friday. Video taken from a Spectrum Bay News 9 helicopter showed at least two trucks on the scene, with crews spraying water on the fire from all sides of the building. Firefighters found no one inside the building. Lt. Garth Swingle, a spokesperson for St. Petersburg Fire Rescue, said the fire was extinguished by 10:07 a.m. Investigators have finished gathering evidence at the scene, but fire units will remain there Friday night and possibly into Saturday morning to watch for signs of flames or smoke, the agency said in a news release around 4:30 p.m. The cause of the fire is under investigation. The total cost of the damage is unknown until third-party appraisals can be done, the release said. The building will be protected by a fence that was provided by the owners. Tyrone Boulevard was closed in both directions between 18th Avenue N and 22nd Avenue N, but it reopened by the afternoon, officials said.
