Video taken from a flight unit camera captured a man’s wild run through a half-dozen cities on Sunday afternoon as he tried to escape from law enforcement. Kenneth Lunford, 27, was arrested on 31 charges after the 45-minute long ordeal, which ended about 5 p.m. Sunday after deputies said Lunford violently crashed a vehicle that he had carjacked, then tried to escape through mangroves and swam into the Intracoastal Waterway. The end of the video shows deputies surrounding him at gunpoint from a dock. The video, which was released by the sheriff’s office, also shows the suspect at one point crashing, then forcing two people out of a black convertible that he carjacked.
