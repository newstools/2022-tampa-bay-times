TAMPA — It’s official: Major League Baseball is now canceling regular-season games. After eight days of negotiations between owners and players, the sides could not come to agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement before Tuesday’s owner-imposed deadline to salvage opening day and a full 162-game season. Shortly after 5 p.m., MLB commissioner Rob Manfred announced that the first two series of the regular season will be canceled, with the potential for further games to be lost to the lockout. This now becomes the second shortened season in the last three, as 2020 was delayed and then abbreviated to 60 games due to the pandemic.
