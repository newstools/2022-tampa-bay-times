INDIANTOWN — Sheriff’s office divers searched a gator-infested canal in a Florida wilderness preserve after human remains were found in the mouth of a large alligator, officials said. Divers for the Martin County Sheriff’s Office searched a large area of the Hungryland Wildlife and Environmental Area near Indiantown after the human remains were found inside the park Thursday. A sheriff’s officer sniper kept watch over the search in case any gators got too close to the divers, the Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post. The park remained closed to visitors during the search.
