All week, landmarks in the Tampa Bay area have lit up blue and yellow to stand with the people of Ukraine. Two beloved St. Petersburg destinations — the Sunshine Skyway and the Bending Arc sculpture at the St. Pete Pier, have joined in. Janet Echelman, the artist behind Bending Arc, designed a new light scheme Thursday. The Tampa Bay native flew to the area Thursday to be a juror in the Gasparilla Festival of the Arts, but stopped by the Pier to customize her piece for Ukraine. “I lived in New York City during 9/11 and I can’t tell you how meaningful it was to me as a New Yorker to receive messages and support from other parts of the world,” she said. “My hope is that we can show support in this small way and help Ukrainians know they aren’t alone.” For one week starting tonight, the Sunshine Skyway will be illuminated with the colors of the Ukraine flag, a Florida Department of Transportation spokesperson confirmed. A photo of the Skyway that looked blue and yellow has been shared many times across Facebook since the weekend, but that photo was not taken this week. The Florida Department of Transportation requires letters of support from the three surrounding counties (Manatee, Hillsborough and Pinellas) to change the lights for a cause. It just received all of the support needed, the agency told the Tampa Bay Times today. Over the last week, numerous local landmarks have been lit blue and yellow, including Tropicana Field, Tampa’s Old City Hall and downtown bridges, the David A. Straz Jr. Center for the Performing Arts and the branding poles throughout the St. Pete Pier.
