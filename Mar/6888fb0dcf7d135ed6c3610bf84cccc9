How about ‘springing back’? Senate votes to end Daylight Saving Time change | March 16 I am mystified by daylight saving time and by those advocating for it to last year-round. In reality, we needn’t ever change away from standard time. But if we are really determined to mess around with time, we should do it in a way that accommodates local climates and our circadian rhythms. Give us winter Daylight Saving Time when days are naturally short and dark. In Florida, shifting the clock would mean later sunsets during months when our weather is the envy of the world. In northern climes it would provide an extra hour of daylight to drive home in the snow more safely or for children to play after school. But the way we currently do it serves no one. Amie Devero, Tampa Split the difference Senate votes to end Daylight Saving Time change | March 16 I don’t understand why we can’t just change the clocks 30 minutes and be done with it. Wouldn’t that satisfy both sides, or are we treating time as if it were a two-party issue? Harriet E. Browder, Clearwater Thanks, senator Senate votes to end Daylight Saving Time change | March 16 I am so thankful we have Sen. Marco Rubio representing the citizens of our state. With everything happening in the world at this time, it is reassuring to know that his main focus is in preserving Daylight Saving Time all year. As always, he has his finger on the issues that are truly meaningful. Peter Castelli, Tampa That takes the cake Politics push policy aside | March 13 Congratulations to our esteemed state legislators for taking care of the people again. While homeowner insurance premiums are skyrocketing and medical issues abound for the poor, among other issues, they take action to make strawberry shortcake the official dessert of the state of Florida.
