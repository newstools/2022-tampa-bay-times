TAMPA — All lanes of Hillsborough Avenue shut down Friday morning after a car crashed into a semitractor-trailer near the road’s on-ramps for Interstate 75, says the Florida Highway Patrol. Video from the crash scene showed a car still wedged under the side of the semitractor-trailer just before 6 a.m. All lanes of Hillsborough Avenue, also known as U.S. 92, were blocked between N Falkenburg Road and the interstate. Troopers say the car’s driver, a 30-year-old Tampa man, was driving east on Hillsborough Avenue when the semitractor-trailer pulled out of a driveway to cross traffic and turn left on the road. The car was traveling too fast to stop before striking the big rig and they collided, the Hitghway Patrol said. The Tampa man and the driver of the truck, a 47-year-old Seffner man, received minor injuries in the crash. There were no passengers in either vehicle. Hillsborough Avenue and N Falkenbrg Road have two lanes with a left turn lane at their intersection. It was not clear when the road will reopen to traffic. This is a developing story.
