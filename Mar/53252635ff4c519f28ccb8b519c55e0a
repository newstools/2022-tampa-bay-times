TAMPA ― Rob Gronkowski hasn’t asked his mom to find his football pants. The Pro Bowl tight end, the foil in that T-Mobile commercial when he came out of retirement to join Tom Brady two years ago, still hasn’t decided whether to play again in 2022, his agent said Thursday. “I talked to Tampa (Wednesday) and I told them that he’s still undecided,” Drew Rosenhaus told reporters Thursday at a news conference in Miami for new Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill. It’s been assumed that Gronkowski would match whatever Brady did regarding his NFL career. But when Brady ended his retirement after only 41 days, Gronkowski did not immediately follow suit. Coach Bruce Arians said at the NFL scouring combine earlier this month that Gronkowski had been working out two days a week at the team’s training facility, even before Brady reversed course. But Gronkowski had a much more difficult season than Brady a year ago. He fractured four ribs and missed five games, while playing in only six snaps in another one at New Orleans. Of course, Gronkowski played a major role in the Bucs winning the NFC South. He caught 55 passes for 802 yards and six touchdowns. Last week, Gronkowski was videotaped at a local barbershop saying he planned to make Brady sweat about his decision. The Bucs have reworked the contract of tight end Cameron Brate, while O.J. Howard signed a one-year deal as a free agent with the Bills. Maybe Gronkowski just needs a better phone service to communicate his decision. The Bucs “have offered the opportunity for Rob to come back,” Rosenhaus said. “I think he’s honestly undecided.” • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
