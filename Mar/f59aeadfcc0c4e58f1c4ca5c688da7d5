Florida’s top-ranked university will have a top-ranked athlete as its commencement speaker this spring. The University of Florida announced that former UF quarterback Tim Tebow, who went on to spend time with five NFL teams and minor league baseball, will return to Ben Hill Griffin Stadium to speak at the university’s spring commencement ceremony on April 29 at 7 p.m. Tebow, a 2009 graduate of UF with a bachelor’s degree in family, youth and community sciences, will speak to graduates following a roller coaster year for the university. It included breaking into the Top 5 public university ranks and becoming mired in nationwide outrage and a federal lawsuit in response to allegations of academic freedom violations. A news release from the university described Tebow as a football analyst, four-time New York Times best-selling author and founder of the Tim Tebow Foundation, a religious-based organization “whose mission is to bring faith, hope and love to those needing a brighter day in their darkest hour of need.” “Tim Tebow is known as much for his hard work, character and commitment to service as he is for his many achievements,” UF president Kent Fuchs said in the news release. “And for those reasons, I know the class of 2022 will benefit greatly from his message and perspective. Whether it be in athletics, philanthropy or in his broader life, Tim sets an example for all of us on what it means to be a leader.” UF expects 6,500 graduates and 45,000 guests.
