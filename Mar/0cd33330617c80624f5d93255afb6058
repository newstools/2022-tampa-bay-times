Cooler temperatures and clear skies are forecast for Tampa Bay this weekend. Before we can enjoy the blissful weather, however, the region is in for a nasty Thursday. There is a strong possibility of severe thunderstorms early in the day, with rain expected for all of Florida’s Gulf Coast, according to the National Weather Service. Spectrum Bay News 9 says there will be an 80 percent chance of rain for the Tampa Bay area specifically. Governmental meteorologists predict the rain will be heaviest in Tampa Bay between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. as a front moves in from the northwest on Thursday. This arrival time may cause some issues for those hoping to enjoy spring training: Home games for the Blue Jays in Dunedin, the Tigers in Lakeland and the Pirates in Bradenton are all slated to begin around 1 p.m. There is some good news about the rain: Bay News 9 Meteorologist Josh Linker says we’ve been drier than usual lately and the region could use some moisture. Most of the rain will be limited to Thursday, Linker says. Only a few lingering showers are expected to continue into Friday morning. After that, Tampa Bay will be dry the rest of the weekend with no chance of showers either day. Tampa’s highs for Saturday and Sunday will be in the mid-70s while the lows will bottom out at 54 on Sunday. Residents of Hernando and Pasco counties may need to pull out a heavier jacket at night. Bay News 9 forecasts the counties could dip as low as the upper 40s on Saturday and Sunday. The pleasant weather will continue into the workweek as temperatures slowly rise. No rain is expected through next Tuesday, which has a forecast high of 80 and a low of 60.
