With municipal elections across 10 Pinellas cities and towns underway Tuesday, the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections said the day has been going successfully and as expected. Dustin Chase, a spokesperson for the office, said he can’t think of a single thing that has so far been unexpected. Before election day began, about 25,000 mail-in ballots had already been cast. As of midday, about 3,500 voters cast ballots day-of. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and voters can find their precinct at https://www.votepinellas.com/Election-Information/Find-Your-Precinct-Polling-Place. Elections are taking place in Belleair, Belleair Beach, Belleair Bluffs, Clearwater, Madeira Beach, Oldsmar, Redington Beach, Redington Shores, St. Pete Beach and Tarpon Springs. A total of 120,616 registered voters live within those areas. So far, turnout is at about 25 percent. Voters with mail-in ballots who didn’t turn them in can still cast their ballot by 7 p.m. at the Supervisor of Elections office at either 315 Court St., Room 117, Clearwater; 13001 Starkey Road, Largo; or 501 First Ave. N, St. Petersburg. Clearwater, the largest city with an election Tuesday, has two of five council seats on the ballot. And in Tarpon Springs, four of five commission seats are up for election. In Oldsmar, a question of development is at the center of the ballot. Nine municipalities canceled their election because of uncontested races.
