PLANT CITY — The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office says it has arrested a man suspected of being behind a fatal shooting that took place in the 3800 block of Medulla Road last week. The shooting happened around 8:30 p.m. Thursday. Deputies responded to a home and found a man dead inside a shed. On Monday, they announced they were searching for 44-year-old Carl Lee of Plant City on a charge of second-degree murder. Deputies did not elaborate on what led them to single out Lee as the suspect. In a news release, the agency said it had developed probable cause to arrest Lee “through investigative means.” The name of the victim was not released. Lee was located in Lithia on Monday afternoon, the Sheriff’s Office said in an updated news release Monday night. He had barricaded himself underneath a shed in the 9300 block of Edison Road, the release said. Members of the agency’s SWAT, crisis negotiation and bomb disposal teams responded to the scene, and Lee was taken into custody a couple of hours later, the Sheriff’s Office said. Jail records show Lee is currently on felony probation. He was arrested in August on charges of grand theft in the third degree and violating a stalking injunction. The Sheriff’s Office said Lee may be armed with a handgun and asked that anyone with information call the agency at (813) 247-8200.
