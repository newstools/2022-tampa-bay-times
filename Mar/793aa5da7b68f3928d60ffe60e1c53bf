Florida wildlife officers intercepted a commercial boat in Tampa Bay on Thursday that had 11,000 pounds of illegally harvested shrimp on board. Officers with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission did an inspection on the vessel, the Dona Lupa out of Port Isabel, Texas, just south of MacDill Air Force Base, the FWC said in a news release. The boat also had several pounds of cobia filets in the freezer and officers also found turtle-excluder device violations. The vessel’s captain, who was not named in the news release, was cited for not having a restricted species endorsement on their Saltwater Products License, failure to display Saltwater Products License on vessel, possession of cobia not in whole condition and the turtle-excluder violations.
