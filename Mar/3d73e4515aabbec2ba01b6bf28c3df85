TAMPA — This week’s SEC men’s basketball tournament at Amalie Arena, already expected to ooze parity, now will feature some poignance to boot. Dick Vitale will make an appearance. The 82-year-old Hall of Fame hoops analyst, waging a valiant public battle against assorted medical issues, including at least two forms of cancer, told the Tampa Bay Times via text message he plans to attend next Saturday’s semifinal round, where the league will honor him. Vitale hasn’t made an in-person appearance at a college game since calling reigning national champ Baylor’s 57-36 triumph against Villanova on Dec. 12. Shortly thereafter, doctors put him on complete voice rest upon discovering pre-cancerous Dysplasia on his vocal cords that required surgery. “I can’t thank (SEC commissioner) Greg Sankey enough for thinking of me,” Vitale texted. A longtime Lakewood Ranch resident, Vitale revealed last fall he’d been diagnosed with lymphoma, only months after multiple surgeries to remove melanoma. He has steadily chronicled his battles on social media, tweeting photos of doctor’s visits and hospital stays while issuing motivational tips of the day recorded well before he was put on voice rest. A prominent fundraiser for children’s cancer research, he’s currently planning his 17th annual Dick Vitale Gala, set for May 6 in Sarasota. The event has raised more than $50 million during its existence for the V Foundation for Cancer Research. Donations can be made at this link. Contact Joey Knight at jknight@tampabay.com.
