OLDSMAR - A 6-year-old girl trying to cross an intersection with her mother and 10-year-old sister Saturday evening was struck and killed by a car, according to the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office. The girl, whose name was not released, was attempting to cross W Petersburg Drive southbound at Bayview Boulevard with her mother, Yanitza Ortega, 40, and her sister after 7 p.m. When the three stepped into the intersection, they were struck by a westbound 2010 Nissan Ultima driven by Eric Hoppes, 40, of Tampa, the sheriff’s office said. All three pedestrians were transported to the hospital, where the 6-year-old was pronounced dead. Ortega and her 10-year-old daughter were treated for non-life threatening injuries. According to investigators, the intersection has no traffic control devices and the pedestrians were not in a crosswalk. Speed or impairment did not appear to be factors in the crash and the car had the right of way, the report said. The investigation is continuing.
