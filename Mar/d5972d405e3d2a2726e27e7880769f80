Indoctrination all the same Gov. DeSantis signs ‘don’t say gay’ bill | March 29 I watched the news as Gov. Ron DeSantis signed House Bill 1557, the “Parental Rights in Education” bill. I was kind of blown away seeing how he had surrounded himself with small children at a charter school. He talked about getting rid of indoctrination of our children. I’m sorry, but that picture depicts indoctrination of our young. That photo op, in my opinion, was way out of line. I’m 78, straight and always believed it’s best to keep your nose out of other people’s lives until you walk a mile in their shoes. M.P. Bosner, Bradenton Compare and contrast Jan. 6 panel missing roughly 8 hours of Trump’s phone calls | March 29 White House records show a 7-hour, 37-minute gap in phone records on Jan. 6. The 18.5 minute tape erasure of a President Richard Nixon/H.R. Haldeman conversation occurred in 1973. Nixon assured us that he was not a crook. Former President Donald Trump continues to whine about “winning” the election. Please contrast and compare the above. Bruce LeBaron, St. Petersburg It’s the profit When you’re Black, whom do you trust with your life? | Column, March 29 I found Dr. Elaine Batchlor’s column profoundly disturbing. As a retired nurse practitioner, I believe that the situation she describes exists but I see it as a result of our for-profit system of health “care,” not racially motivated. There are many providers who are motivated by the bottom line. The patient is discounted. But it happens across racial lines. We need universal health care. Would Dr. Batchlor agree? Fern Williams, Zephyrhills Something was missing Thousands celebrate at joyous Tampa Pride | March 28 In Monday’s paper not a word or picture from the MacDill Air Fest open house, but on the front page is coverage of a gay pride parade in Tampa. The Tampa Bay Times sure has different news judgment than I do. Rick Johnson, St. Petersburg
