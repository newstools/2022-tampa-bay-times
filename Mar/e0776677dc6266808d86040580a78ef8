TAMPA — A former Tampa Police Department officer has been arrested on 100 counts of child pornography possession, Chief Mary O’Connor said in a news conference Wednesday night. Paul Mumford, 61, was arrested Wednesday afternoon and faces charges of child pornography possession. The department received a tip in December from someone who claimed that Mumford had illegal images of children on his personal electronic devices, according to O’Connor. Police served search warrants at his two homes in January — one in Hillsborough County and the other in north Florida — and detectives found child pornography on multiple devices, according to O’Connor. “I feel confident that I speak for all Tampa PD officers tonight when I say that this case is disturbing and disappointing, to say the least,” O’Connor said. Mumford served as an officer from June 1986 to September 2015, according to the Tampa Police Department. Mumford retired as a sergeant and became a reserve officer, she said. Mumford was fired from his work as a reserve officer in February, O’Connor said. Mumford worked in the department’s sex crimes unit from 2008 to 2009, O’Connor said. There is no evidence that Mumford obtained the child pornography from the Tampa Police Department, she said, but the investigation is ongoing. When Mumford worked in the sex crimes unit, they mostly investigated sexual battery and child abuse cases, O’Connor said. The Internet Crimes Against Children unit is fairly new and was formed around 2015 —which was after Mumford had retired, she said. The Tampa Police Department will likely have to work with other police agencies to identify the children in the photos, O’Connor said. Mumford’s bond is set at $750,000, according to a Hillsborough County jail log. This is a developing story. Stay with tampabay.com for updates.
