Lately Tampa finds itself ranked more and more on lists of “bests” across the country. So why not pizza pie? A 2022 ranking of “The Best Pizza Cities in America” by AnytimeEstimate.com ranked Tampa 12th out of its top 15 pizza cities. Detroit topped the list. Cities got points for pizza variations, number of pizza joints per square mile, affordability and the number of independent and big chain pizza restaurants per 100,000 residents, among other factors. New York, while having the highest density of pizza shops per square mile, was hurt by its “low share of independent pizzerias,” the ranking said. In fact, New York did not make the top 15. According to the survey, Tampa boasts eight pizza joints for every 100,000 residents, who spend a higher percentage of annual income on pizza than any other city in the top 15. An average cheese pizza here will cost you $8.73 — not as thrifty as Nashville at $6.65, but not as pricey as Philly at $9.71. Tampa has a pizza restaurant every 1.75 miles — “38% better than the average city we studied,” the ranking said. “Tampa also has 4.3 independent pizza restaurants per 100,000 residents — seventh-most of the cities we measured.” Then there’s our taste in pizza: “Fans of Tampa pizza must have an affinity for the Mediterranean, as the city ranks No. 4 in search interest for Greek pizza and No. 5 in interest for Neapolitan pizza,” the survey said.
