TAMPA ― The Bucs made a series of changes to their coaching staff for 2022. The team announced Tuesday that Larry Foote will move from outside linebackers to inside linebackers. He replaces Mike Caldwell, who was hired as the Jaguars’ defensive coordinator. Veteran assistant Bob Sanders, who worked for head coach Bruce Arians for three seasons with the Arizona Cardinals, will coach outside linebackers. Sanders, 68, last coached in the NFL in 2017. He served as the Orlando Apollos’ defensive coordinator in the Alliance of American Football (AAF) in 2019. Sanders previously worked for 14 years on Steve Spurrier’s staffs at Duke and Florida. The Bucs hired two new quality control coaches. Jeff Kastl, a former offensive coordinator at Indiana State, will work on offense. Joey Fitzgerald, who coached quarterbacks at Northwestern State last season, will work on defense. Tim Atkins will replace Cody Grimm as defensive/special teams assistant. Grimm was hired by the Jaguars as safeties coach. John Van Dam takes over as Bucs tight ends coach after assisting at that position last season. Former tight ends coach Rick Christophel will move into a new role as senior offensive assistant. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
