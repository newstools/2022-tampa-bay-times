Free-agent offensive lineman Fred Johnson, who made 33 career starts in his four seasons at Florida, has signed a one-year deal with the Bucs following a three-year stint in Cincinnati. Johnson, 24, adds depth and versatility to a unit that lost its two starting guards — Ali Marpet and Alex Cappa — to retirement and free agency, respectively. A tackle with the Bengals, for whom he started eight games over the past three seasons, Johnson (6-feet-7, 326 pounds) primarily played right guard at UF, making 23 starts at the position his final two seasons (2017-2018). Undrafted out of college, the West Palm Beach native was signed by the Steelers and made their initial 53-man roster in 2019 but was waived in October of that year. He signed shortly thereafter with the Bengals and appeared in 23 games over the past three seasons. He reportedly signed a tender with Cincinnati earlier this week before being waived. The Bengals spent the dawn of NFL free agency fortifying an offensive line that surrendered 55 sacks last season, adding former right guard Cappa as well as center Ted Karras (Patriots) and offensive tackle La’el Collins (Cowboys). • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
