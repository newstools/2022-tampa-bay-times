Hillsborough County wants public input on improving the county’s Veterans Memorial Park. A workshop and open house are planned for Thursday. Residents will be  asked to detail how they use the park and what additions they would like to see. The workshop is from 9:30 a.m. to noon, and the open house will be 4 to 7 p.m. Both events will be at the park at 3602 N. U.S. 301, Tampa. Workshop participants are asked to register in advance at Hillsboroughcounty.org. Registration is not required for the open house. An online engagement forms also will be available for the next three weeks. Hillsborough County Conservation & Environmental Lands Management, which owns the property, and Hillsborough County Consumer & Veterans Services, which runs day-to-day operations, will work with the University of South Florida’s Florida Center for Community Design and Research to create a master plan for the park. Veterans Memorial Park is home to 14 war memorials, the Veterans Resource Center, and the Rear Admiral Leroy Collins, Jr. Veterans Museum. It also serves as a venue for regional ceremonies on Veterans Day, Memorial Day, and Patriot Day, along with other events. Oak trees there provide a well-shaded and tranquil setting for reading, reflection, meditation, picnicking or gathering as a family. Walkers and joggers also use the park’s many paths including a fitness trail along the Bypass Canal.
