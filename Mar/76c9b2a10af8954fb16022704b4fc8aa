TAMPA — The Bucs filled one of their holes on the offensive line by reaching an agreement on a one-year deal with guard Aaron Stinnie, preventing him from becoming a free agent when the negotiating period begins Monday. Stinnie will received a $1.4 million contract that could earn him as much as $2.5 million in 2022 with incentives. It’s a great insurance policy for the Bucs, who need to secure the interior of their offensive line with the unexpected retirement of Pro Bowl guard Ali Marpet. Tampa Bay will also see Pro Bowl center Ryan Jensen and guard Alex Cappa hit the free-agent market beginning Monday. Stinnie will at least provide some experience and continuity. When Cappa broke his arm in the NFC wildcard game at Washington two years ago, Stinnie stepped in and played well in three postseason games, including Super Bowl 55. Also on Saturday, the Bucs reduced defensive tackle Vita Vea’s $10.6 million salary to $1.12 million and a $9.46 million bonus to help create cap space. The team is expected to restructure other contracts with outside linebacker Shaquil Barrett, left tackle Donovan Smith, linebacker Lavonte David and receiver Mike Evans the likely candidates. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
