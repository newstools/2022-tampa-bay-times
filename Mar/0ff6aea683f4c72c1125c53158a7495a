MANATEE — A woman crashed into a Florida Highway Patrol vehicle Sunday morning after failing to stop for multiple road closure signs put in place for the Skyway 10K race, troopers said. Kristen Kay Watts, 52, from Sarasota, was arrested on a charge of driving under the influence resulting in serious injury after she drove onto a portion of northbound Interstate 275 that was closed for the Skyway 10K race and crashed nearly head-on into a trooper’s SUV, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. Watts was driving a 2011 BMW 335i north on Interstate 275 at a high rate of speed about 8:45 a.m. Sunday when she approached a road closure for the race and failed to detour onto U.S. 41 as directed, troopers said. Instead, Watts drove through multiple traffic cones and other barricades with state officers present. Officers tried to pull over Watts but she continued driving north, troopers said. Watts then came upon two Florida Fish and Wildlife officers guarding the northbound toll plaza and failed to stop. Two Florida Highway Patrol troopers in separate vehicles drove south in the northbound lane to intercept Watts and protect the thousands of race participants still on foot on the Sunshine Skyway bridge. Both patrol vehicles stopped. Within moments, Watts collided nearly head-on with one of them, a marked 2019 Chevy Tahoe. The crashed caused serious injuries to Watts and the trooper behind the wheel of the Tahoe, a 47-year-old Tampa woman. Watts and the trooper were taken to nearby hospitals. The Highway Patrol did not release the trooper’s name. The annual Skyway 10K race raises money for the Armed Forces Families Foundation. As of 2 p.m. the Florida Highway Patrol was in the process of opening the northbound lanes of Interstate 275. This is a developing story. Stay with tampabay.com for updates.
