TAMPA — In the moments after Tom Brady said his place isn’t in the stands — yet — Bucs fans were trying to convince themselves that the seven-time Super Bowl champion really will be back on the field in 2022. The Tampa Bay quarterback announced Sunday on social media that he has “unfinished business” and is returning for a 23rd season in the NFL. The announcement came just six weeks after Brady seemed to announce his retirement from football, saying “it’s time to focus my time and energy on other things that require my attention.” It also stole some of the thunder from the NCAA Tournament selection shows. The Bucs’ 2021 season ended with a 30-27 loss to the Rams Jan. 23 in a division-round game, three wins short of their goal of repeating as Super Bowl champions.
