TAMPA — A 9-year-old girl was shot in the lower back Tuesday night at Robles Park after an argument between teenagers at the basketball courts there turned violent, Tampa police say. The shooting happened around 7:14 p.m. inside the park, at E Lake Avenue and N Avon Avenue, police say. One teenage boy left the courts after an altercation with another. He went home, grabbed a gun, returned and opened fire in the direction of the basketball courts, striking the girl in the lower back, police said. She was taken to a hospital, where she remained in stable condition Wednesday, Tampa police Capt. Les Richardson said in a media briefing Wednesday afternoon. Police took the boy who fired the shot into custody Tuesday night. The boy, 15, is facing charges of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and being a juvenile in possession of a firearm, Richardson said. Detectives do not know how the boy obtained a gun, Richardson said. The Tampa Police Department is continuing to investigate the incident.
