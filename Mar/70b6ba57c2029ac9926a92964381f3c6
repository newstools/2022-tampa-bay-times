CHICAGO — Rookie forward Boris Katchouk entered the league’s COVID-19 protocol before the Lightning opened their six-game road trip Sunday against the Blackhawks. As a result, Katchouk will not be available for the games Tuesday in Winnipeg, Thursday in Calgary, Saturday in Edmonton and Sunday in Vancouver. The Lightning hadn’t lost a player to the protocol in about a month, since Nikita Kucherov returned from it Feb. 10. The NHL stopped testing asymptomatic players and staff members following the All-Star break. But with the Lightning leaving for Canada following Sunday’s game, all members of the traveling party had to be tested. Katchouk played 9:22 in the Lightning’s 3-1 win over the Red Wings on Friday in Tampa after being a healthy scratch for the previous seven games. He has two goals and four assists in 37 games this season. Katchouk has been an important depth piece for the Lightning, and they will be affected by his absence if they lose another forward in Canada. Contact Eduardo A. Encina at eencina@tampabay.com.
