The SEC men’s basketball tournament begins today in Tampa and, if the oddsmakers are correct, Kentucky will leave Amalie Arena as the champion. The Wildcats have +175 odds to win the league, according to BetMGM. That means a $100 bet wins $175. That’s comparable to another betting site, betonline.ag, which has Kentucky at +200. Auburn is next, at +260 and +275, depending on the site. Tennessee is +325 and $400, while Arkansas is the other main contender (+750 and +500). Florida is in the middle of the pack with +4,000 odds on both sites. That seems fitting for a team that has been mediocre for much of the season. Georgia, Missouri and Mississippi have the longest odds. The Bulldogs come in at +50,000 at both sites. The Gators enter the conference tournament on the verge of missing the big dance. UF’s odds of making the NCAA tournament are 4/1, according to betonline.ag. That’s compared to 1/7 odds of not making the field of 68. The SEC tournament begins today at 6 p.m. when Mississippi faces Missouri. Georgia and Vanderbilt play each other in the second part of the doubleheader. Day 2 starts when the Gators play Texas A&M at noon. All games will be shown on either the SEC Network or ESPN. The SEC tournament is scheduled to be in Nashville through at least 2030, with an option to extend it through 2035. Mississippi State won the event the last time it was here (2009), at what was then called the St. Pete Times Forum. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
