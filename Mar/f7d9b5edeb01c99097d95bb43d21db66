TAMPA — It’s an annual rite of spring, like birds chirping or orange blossoms blooming: Mike Evans restructured his contract to create some salary cap space for the Bucs. The Pro Bowl receiver agreed to have some of his $14 million base salary converted into a bonus in order to allow the Bucs to sign more free agents. It’s the fourth time Evans has done this for the Bucs. He will save the team about $10.3 million in salary cap space this season. Prior to the restructure, Evans would have counted $20.62 million against the cap. The Bucs likely will have to rework some other deals, including Tom Brady’s; he’s on the books for making less than $11 million this season. Other candidates for restructures would include tackle Donovan Smith and possibly linebacker Lavonte David, although that would require the team to add another year. i• • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
