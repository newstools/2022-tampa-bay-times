The tournament field includes 140 players, with one sponsor exemption still to be determined. Monday’s open qualifier at Southern Hills will determine the final four golfers. Defending champion and world No. 17 Sam Burns is ready to defend his title, battling 20 other of the world’s top 50 players. Additionally, seven of the tournament’s past champions will compete.
