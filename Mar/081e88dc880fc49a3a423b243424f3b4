BRANDON — After making two key additions to their forward group in the days leading up to Monday’s 3 p.m. trade deadline, the Lightning made an 11th-hour deal to reacquire veteran center Riley Nash. The Lightning got Nash, 32, from the Arizona Coyotes for future considerations. Because he cleared waivers earlier in the day, the Lightning were able to reassign him to AHL Syracuse. He will serve as a depth forward piece in case of injury. This is Nash’s second stint with the Lightning this season. He was claimed off waivers Dec. 7 from Winnipeg when Tampa Bay was without both Nikita Kucherov and Brayden Point. He played 10 games with the Lightning, averaging 11:22 as a fourth-line center before he was claimed off waivers by the Coyotes on Jan. 6. He had four assists in 24 games with Arizona. In recent days, the Lightning made two major trades, acquiring forward Brandon Hagel from Chicago for two first-round picks, plus rookie forwards Taylor Raddysh and Boris Katchouk. Sunday night, Tampa Bay completed a trade with Ottawa for forward Nick Paul, sending forward Mathieu Joseph and a fourth-round pick to the Senators, who agreed to cover 44.5 percent of Paul’s remaining 2021-22 salary. • • • The Tampa Bay Times has commemorated the Lightning’s second consecutive Stanley Cup title with a new hardcover coffee table book, Striking Twice.
