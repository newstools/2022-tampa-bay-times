PORT CHARLOTTE — The Rays added a needed right-handed hitter to their outfield mix, acquiring Harold Ramirez from the Cubs for minor-league infielder Esteban Quiroz. Ramirez, 27, has played parts of three seasons in the majors with Miami and Cleveland. In 221 games, he has a .271 average with 18 homers, 82 RBIs and a .714 OPS. Ramirez was first signed by the Pirates out of Colombia and reached prospect status with Pittsburgh, ranking eighth on a 2015 mlb.com list that included current Rays Tyler Glasnow, who was No. 1, and Austin Meadows, No. 4. Ramirez was traded to Toronto in 2016, then signed as a free agent in 2018 with Miami. He was claimed on waivers by Cleveland in February 2021 and purchased by the Cubs in November. Quiroz, 30, played in 68 games for Triple-A Durham last season. To make room on the 40-man roster, the Rays placed reliever Nick Anderson, who is recovering from surgery, on the 60-day injured list. • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
