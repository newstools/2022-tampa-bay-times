A career diplomat with Tampa Bay ties will soon call Belgrade, Serbia, his home after being appointed and confirmed as the U.S. ambassador to Serbia. Christopher Hill was announced as the nominee by President Joe Biden in October and was confirmed by the Senate in March. He has a home on Treasure Island and has previously spoken at USF events about diplomacy. “I have learned over the years to respect history and to try to learn its complex lessons, but my suitcase will not be heavy with the past,” Hill said in a statement. “I am arriving with a fresh perspective to the Serbia of 2022, to a country that the United States views as an important partner and a friend.” Hill previously served under multiple presidents as an ambassador in the Republic of Korea, Poland, Macedonia and, most recently, Iraq, before retiring from foreign service in 2010. From 2005 to 2009, Hill led the U.S. delegation in talks over nuclear weapons in North Korea. He also previously served as the dean of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver and is an adjunct professor at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. Hill said in his statement that he believes the U.S. and Serbia can forge stronger ties over “common interests.” “I believe in the vision of a dynamic Serbia-U.S. relationship, one based on a deep foundation of mutual respect,” he said.
