The new company, under the name Big Sea, will offer marketing, branding, video production and web development services, according to a press release. “Our clients are asking for deeper strategy and more thorough research, and we’re excited to grow our capabilities and consultative services to do just that,” said Andi Graham, CEO and managing partner of Big Sea in a statement. Graham and Dzuy Nguyen, Big Sea’s chief operating officer and managing partner, will retain their titles with the combined agency. Sparxoo president Rob Kane will keep his title as he joins Big Sea, and Sparxoo Studios will now be led by Michael Martz. David Capece, founder and CEO of Sparxoo, will leave the agency to grow his software company CROOW, the release said. The merger will strengthen the company’s digital capabilities and experience in design and video storytelling. The new company will have 42 employees and $6 million in annual revenues, the release said. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.
