ZEPHYRHILLS — Social media accounts of best friends Ashley Wooten and Jasmine Dutton have filled with memories and photos of the two Zephyrhills mothers since they were killed in a one-car crash last Saturday. Wooten, 25, was driving south on Crystal Springs Road at 2 a.m. when she lost control for unknown reasons, the Florida Highway Patrol said. The car left the roadway and struck a tree near Douglas Road, killing both women. A memorial has since been erected at the crash site, where photos hang from a tree surrounded by flowers, lights and crosses. Fundraising campaigns have been started to help both families. Dutton, 27, had a husband and a 6-year-old daughter, according to a GoFundMe page set up in her name for funeral costs. The page had raised $4,300 of its $10,000 goal by Friday morning. “There is no amount of money that could suffice in curing the heartache this devastating loss has brought to her loved ones,” the GoFundMe page said. “God I miss you,” Dawn Bush, Dutton’s mother, said in a Facebook post. “I don’t know how we are supposed to go on in life without you.” Wooten, who would have turned 26 Friday, leaves behind two daughters and a partner. Her Facebook profile picture shows the family at Disney World on March 9, which she said was her daughters’ first trip. Wooten’s father, John Wooten, announced in a Facebook post that Zephyrhills will close Main Street on Sunday, March 27, to host a fundraiser for the women’s families. The event will run from the morning until 10 p.m. “You are missed and loved so much my Angel,” John Wooten said in the post. Funeral dates have not been set but separate memorial services for the two women are planned this weekend. The deaths have drawn an outpouring of support in the tight-knit Zephyrhills community. The women attended Zephyrhills High School and have worked in the city, Wooten as a restaurant server and Dutton at a farm supply store.
