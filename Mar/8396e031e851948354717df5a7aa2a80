A much anticipated 21-foot flamingo sculpture is now a reality at Tampa International Airport, in the center of the Main Terminal The bird’s head, neck and legs have been placed near The Shoppes at Bayshore. Full completion of the installation is expected by late April or early May. The floor-to-ceiling installation, titled Home, was created by artist Matthew Mazzotta. It depicts a flamingo as it dips its head under water to take a drink. The water will be depicted by metal panels and lighting that will be attached to the ceiling and have yet to be installed. The artwork was chosen out of 700 proposals of public art from around the world. It was approved by the Hillsborough County Aviation Authority’s Board of Directors in February of 2020. “Tampa International Airport has always been a champion of iconic public art as a way to welcome our visitors and give them a sense of wonder and whimsy when they arrive in our beautiful region,” Chris Minner, executive vice president of marketing and communications at the airport and a member of its public art committee, said in a news release. “We’re certain that Home will help create memories and inspire people of all ages who begin and end their travel journeys at TPA.” Once the installation is completed, the public is encouraged to interact with it.
