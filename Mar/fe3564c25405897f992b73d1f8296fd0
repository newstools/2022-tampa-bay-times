TAMPA — While doctor’s orders won’t allow him to speak when he arrives at Amalie Arena on Saturday, the glow in Dick Vitale’s 82-year-old countenance almost certainly will convey gratitude and glee. ESPN’s Hall of Fame college basketball analyst is cancer-free. Vitale, who has been undergoing treatment for lymphoma, announced Tuesday on his social-media platforms that a recent PET scan revealed no cancer and that he’s currently in remission. “Let me tell you, that brought tears of joy to me and my family,” Vitale said on his Facebook page. “Dr. (Rick) Brown (head of the medical team treating his lymphoma) said I must do a couple of more chemotherapy treatments to make certain all cancer cells are gone. It certainly was great news and I must thank all of you that have sent so many prayers, messages of encouragement and lots of love my way.” Vitale will make his first appearance at a college basketball game in three months when he attends Saturday afternoon’s semifinals of the SEC tournament at Amalie Arena. Doctors have put him on total voice rest, however, after discovering precancerous dysplasia on his vocal cords that required surgery a few months back. SEC spokesman Herb Vincent said the league is recognizing Vitale for his public cancer battle as well as his many years of promoting the sport and calling SEC contests. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
