Will Pinellas County Commissioner Kathleen Peters win reelection with no significant opposition? Pinellas Democrats are searching for a prominent challenger to Peters, a Republican former state House member now finishing her first term as a commissioner. But so far, with qualifying June 13-17, they’re coming up dry. The candidate many had hoped would run, former St. Petersburg City Council member Darden Rice, said this week she won’t. Rice just finished an unsuccessful campaign for mayor and is applying for a job as deputy director of the Florida Sierra Club. “I’ve had many people call to ask me to run and I’m not interested,” she said. “It’s too soon and just not what I have planned in my life right now.” “That’s a disappointment to me — I was so hoping,” said county Democratic Chair Lucinda Johnston. “I think she was our best option, but I don’t think she’s our only option.” Johnston said she wasn’t ready to name other possibilities. Also declining is council member Amy Foster, who said she’s interested in serving at the county level but doesn’t live in Peters’ district. In 2018, Peters raised $251,259 — more than the other four candidates combined — and defeated Democrat Amy Kedron by 60-40 percent.
