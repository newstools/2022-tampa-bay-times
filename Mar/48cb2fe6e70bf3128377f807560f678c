The Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office and other law enforcement agencies in Pinellas County will be conducting a “wolf pack” this weekend to apprehend impaired drivers. The county-wide effort is dedicated to the memory of Yvonne Meyers, who was 18 when she was killed by a drunk driver in 1992. The sheriff’s office said in a news release Friday that law enforcement officers “will maintain a proactive profile over the weekend on the highly traveled roadways of Pinellas County.” The operation will begin at 7 p.m. Saturday and end at 5 a.m. Sunday. “The operation is part of the Pinellas County Sheriff’s on-going commitment to reduce deaths, injuries and property damage associated with traffic crashes related to impaired driving,” the agency’s news release states “The goal of the Wolf Pack is to educate people and create public awareness about the dangers of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and any chemical or controlled substances.” Other agencies taking part in the wolf pack are: The Florida Highway Patrol, Treasure Island Police Department, Indian Shores Police Department, Kenneth City Police Department, Largo Police Department, Pinellas Park Police Department, St. Petersburg Police Department, Clearwater Police Department and the Tarpon Springs Police Department.
