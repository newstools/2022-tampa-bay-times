ZEPHYRHILLS — Grind for Life, a national, all-ages and skills skateboarding contest series, will take place from 9 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. on Saturday at the Zephyrhills Skate Park, 39096 Alston Ave., Zephyrhills. Grind For Life was founded in 2003 by life-long skateboarder Mike Rogers after his second battle with sarcoma cancer. Having beat cancer twice, he also beat the odds by becoming a competitive skateboarder again. His not-for-profit charity assists cancer patients with travel expenses. The city of Zephyrhills has been a host for a leg of the skateboarding event for several years, with public works crew members providing cleanup assistance. To view footage from last year’s event produced by RIDE Channel, visit this site. In addition to men’s and women’s bowl and street divisions, there’s also an “adaptive” skateboarding division for athletes with disabilities. The registration cost is $35 online. Participation is limited to 175 entries at gflseries.com. Opened in 2015, Zephyrhills Skate Park is an approximately 8,000-square-foot skate park. The bowl is multi-level, with pool coping, tile and steel coping, escalators, extension, five corners and two hips. The street course features quarter pipes, hips, china banks, textured banks, rails and ledges, and jersey barriers. One of the rails is an actual piece of railroad track.
