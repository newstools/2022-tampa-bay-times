A man was shot Monday on the Howard Frankland Bridge after he flashed his lights, honked and braked suddenly in front of a vehicle, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. Troopers later spoke with the victim, Tyeson Jordan, who drove himself to the hospital, and his passenger Jacqueline Slaughter, after the Monday evening shooting on the southbound lanes of Interstate 275. Slaughter told troopers Jordan was driving his 2016 Dodge Charger south when he approached a slower moving vehicle. Jordan flashed his lights and honked his car horn. Slaughter described the vehicle as a dark colored SUV with side window tint. Jordan then passed the car and merged in front of the SUV. Once he was in front of the car, Jordan “brake checked” the SUV, meaning he intentionally and suddenly hit his brakes, according to troopers. Jordan then tried to escape from the other vehicle, but the SUV pursued him, changing several lanes to keep up. Slaughter told troopers she heard a popping sound while she and Jordan were in the center lane. Glass struck her face, and that was when she noticed Jordan had been shot. Jordan continued to drive and told Slaughter to take a picture of the car with her phone, according to troopers. She couldn’t, she told troopers, because the phone’s lock screen was covered in blood. After the shooting, the SUV continued south on the bridge. Jordan guided Slaughter to an interstate exit and to an emergency room. He was later taken to a trauma center at Bayfront Health St. Petersburg. Troopers and local law enforcement met him there. He was listed in stable condition Tuesday morning, troopers said.
