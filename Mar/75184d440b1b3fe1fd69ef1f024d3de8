RUSKIN — A hostage situation ended peacefully Monday night after four hours of negotiation, the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office said. Sean Porter, 35, took a man and woman hostage inside a shed on the 1900 block of 33rd Street SE. A news release from the Sheriff’s Office says Porter got into an argument with someone at the home and fired one shot before he then barricaded himself with the duo around 5:40 p.m. Monday. Deputies say Porter made other threats to “harm himself and others,” but did not elaborate on those threats. The Sheriff’s Office’s SWAT and crisis negotiation teams were sent to the home. Negotiators then spoke with Porter for over four hours before he surrendered himself peacefully, deputies say. Nobody was injured in the incident, despite there being evidence of a “potential gunshot” in the shed. Deputies say they responded to Porter’s home around 4 p.m. Monday for a welfare check because he was making threats to harm himself but couldn’t find him, so they left. Porter was arrested Monday night but deputies have not said what they plan to charge him with. Deputies say Porter has a history of mental illness. The 35-year-old also has past convictions for battery, domestic violence, false imprisonment and witness tampering. Porter had not been booked into the County Jail as of 1 a.m. Tuesday.
