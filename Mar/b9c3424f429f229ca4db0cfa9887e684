Rena Walters posted on Facebook thanking all those who tried to help her family find answers about her sister. Teneisha Griffith, the 27-year-old South Tampa woman who had been missing for days, had died, she wrote. “It is with a heavy and broken heart that we say Teneisha is no longer with us,” she wrote. “Our family is irreparably broken. We will never be the same. We lost a young, charismatic, funny, and truly one of a kind individual way too soon.” The family had called on the public to provide Tampa Police with any information after they lost contact with Griffith last Friday. Tampa police said Saturday morning that they had no information to release immediately. On Saturday afternoon, the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office said it has taken over the investigation but was unable to provide details.  This is a developing story and will be updated.
