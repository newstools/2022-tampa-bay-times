In the top of the second inning on a mild Tuesday afternoon, USF softball ace Georgina Corrick surrendered a rare single. Minutes later, she became singular. Corrick’s third-inning strikeout of Canisius sophomore Destiny Falquez gave her 1,104 for her dominant career, eclipsing the program’s career record held by former Pinellas Park High standout Sara Nevins, a member of the school’s athletics Hall of Fame. By the end of the 5-0 Bulls romp, Corrick had fanned 14 Canisius hitters, increasing her career strikeout total to 1,113. Four strikeouts shy of Nevins’ total entering the contest, Corrick needed only eight batters to break the record. She received hugs from catcher Josie Foreman and her infielders before returning to work. A 6-foot senior who starred at Sanford’s Seminole High and plays for the British national team (she was born in England but raised in central Florida), Corrick’s milestone represented the latest highlight in an already historic season. She pitched the program’s fourth perfect game (a five-inning, 9-0 romp of Florida A&M) earlier this month, and set school and American Athletic Conference marks with a recent streak of 88.1 consecutive scoreless innings. Entering Tuesday’s game, she had struck out 215 and allowed only three earned runs in 141 innings for a 0.15 ERA. With 229 strikeouts this year, she’s within reach of the program’s single-season strikeout mark (336) set by Nevins in 2012. The Bulls (28-7) have 21 regular-season games remaining, including a three-game home series against UCF starting Friday. Contact Joey Knight at jknight@tampabay.com.
