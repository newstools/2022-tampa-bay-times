A Tampa Bay Times reporting team has been named one of six finalists for the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting for exposing dangers at a Tampa lead factory and the surrounding community. Reporters Corey G. Johnson, Rebecca Woolington and Eli Murray were recognized for their “Poisoned” investigation, a series that prompted government investigations, steep fines, a credit downgrade and increased regulatory scrutiny of Gopher Resource, which operates the state’s only lead smelter. The project was completed with support from PBS FRONTLINE’s Local Journalism Initiative, which provided partial funding and consultation. The six finalists were named by the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, which administers the prize at Harvard University’s Kennedy School. The winner will be announced at a ceremony April 5. Other finalists are: The six teams of finalists each receive $10,000, and the winner will receive a $25,000 prize. The Times was a finalist for the award last year for an investigation into a Pasco County Sheriff’s Office program that harassed residents without probable cause, and also in 2016 for a series exposing how Pinellas County schools abandoned integration and then deprived predominantly Black schools of resources.
