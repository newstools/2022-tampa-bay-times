Here’s your feel-good story of the day. They say dogs are man’s best friend but the tables turned Wednesday, when an unfortunate pooch got stuck in the mud in a Florida canal. According to the Palm Bay Police Department, a concerned citizen alerted cops about a dog that “was unable to free itself.” K9 Officer Carrol, who knows a thing or two about handling dogs, “sprung into action” and freed the golden retriever, said the Palm Bay Police Department’s Facebook page. Apparently, the rescue occurred just in the nick of time. “The water was cold, and it appeared the dog had been there for some time, worn out and tired,” read the post. In the accompanying video, you see the dog helplessly lodged in sludge, wailing and barking. The officer steadies himself on solid ground, places a leash around the animal’s neck and then picks it up in his arms. Later the cop and pup pose together while dry on land. The animal had no collar or tags; but in the comments section, a fellow Facebook user wrote in that it was indeed their family’s dog and all are happily reunited. “He is home safe,” said the post from the handle @RachelleDugan, and “I am so so thankful to the officer who found him.” The poster went on to say that the dog was her dad’s, who died in July, and he had somehow escaped from the back gate about an hour before being rescued. “He is home, bathed and snuggled.”
