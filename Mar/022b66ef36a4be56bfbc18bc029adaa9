TAMPA — Starting today, it will no longer be free to park on the street for two hours in Ybor City. The city announced that street parking in the neighborhood bounded by Nuccio Parkway, 22nd Street, Palm Avenue and Adamo Drive will cost $1.50 an hour starting today. But drivers will find free parking for up to two hours at three city-owned lots in Ybor, according to a city news release. The locations of the city lots are 1701 N 19th St., 1812 N 19th St. and 1813 N 19th St. The change is intended to reduce by up to 30 percent congestion caused by drivers circling to find open spaces on the street. And it should help create parking for customers of local businesses. “We know these changes will help increase parking turnover in the business district of Ybor City,” said Vik Bhide, the city’s mobility director, in the release. “This will especially help with the lack of freight and loading and unloading spots for businesses.” Pay station kiosks are being installed and will be ready to launch today. Users can pay by using the ParkMobile app or by entering their license plate number at the pay station. The city is also creating 100 new spaces by adding pavement markings around Ybor, according to the release.
