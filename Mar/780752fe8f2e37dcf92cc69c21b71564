TAMPA — Nasty weather is putting a dent in St. Patrick’s Day celebrations in Tampa and St. Petersburg. The city of Tampa’s River O’ Green St. Patrick’s Day celebration has been postponed a day and the inaugural Shamrock Fest at the St. Pete Pier has been canceled. Both events were to take place Saturday. There is an 80 percent chance of rain Saturday, said John McMichael of the National Weather Service. Add in a strong likelihood of severe thunderstorms to start the day and conditions are far from ideal to be outdoors. The River O’Green Fest runs 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday at Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park against the backdrop of a green-dyed Hillsborough River and featuring live entertainment, food trucks, beer, and family-friendly activities. Conditions will be much better for it: The forecast calls for clear skies and no rain Sunday, with a high temperature of 66 at mid-day. In staying true to their name, one Tampa group is scheduled to stick with Saturday for their event — rain or shine. The Rough Riders krewe, who have been holding a St. Patrick’s Day parade in Ybor City for more than 40 years, said Wednesday they still plan to through historic Ybor City with their parade of historic floats from 7 to 10 p.m. Saturday.
