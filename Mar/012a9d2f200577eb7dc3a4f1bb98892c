Florida ranked second among all states in technology job growth last year, according to a new industry association study. The Sunshine State added 10,522 new tech jobs in 2021, more than any state besides Texas, which added 10,851, according to the Computing Technology Industry Association, or CompTIA. Both Texas and Florida gained more than twice the number of tech jobs as the No. 3 state on the list, California, which added 5,165. But by another measure, Florida beat all comers. The state added 2,715 technology businesses in 2021, far more than Texas (1,807) and California (1,199). Overall, tech workers held 446,266 jobs in Florida in 2021, fourth-most in the nation behind California, Texas and New York. In the study, Florida had three of the top 25 metropolitan markets for net tech jobs added: Miami at No. 4, adding 2,072 jobs; Orlando at No. 16, adding 622 jobs; and Tampa Bay at No. 21, adding 406 jobs. All three markets are expected to add even more tech jobs next year, with Tampa Bay expected to double its growth, adding 1,186 jobs. But other markets contributed to the growth, too. In a separate study released earlier in March, the Computing Technology Industry Association pegged Tallahassee as one of the top 20 “tech towns” in America for its “vibrant business climate with advanced research and development in local universities and entrepreneurial energy.” The total economic impact of the technology industry in Florida in 2021 was $70 billion, according to the study. In Tampa Bay, it was $15.5 billion. The median tech job wage in Florida last year was $79,397, or 113 percent higher than the statewide median average across all sectors. In Tampa Bay, it was $83,262 or 116 percent higher than the regional median.
