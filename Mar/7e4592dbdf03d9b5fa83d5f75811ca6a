MASARYKTOWN — A pickup truck driver didn’t see a bicyclist riding in front of him and struck and killed the man, the Florida Highway Patrol said. The collision occurred at 6:51 a.m. Friday on U.S. 41 at County Line Road in Masaryktown, an intersection with a traffic light where each road has two lanes and a left turn lane. The driver of the Ford F-250, a 34-year-old Clearwater man, was in the southbound right turn lane before he hit the bicyclist. The driver was not injured. The bicyclist lived in Masaryktown, and troopers were trying to notify his relatives in Honduras. The Highway Patrol did not release the names of either man. The victim is the first pedestrian or bicyclist killed in Hernando County in 2022, according to data reported by law enforcement agencies.
