If you’ve ever wondered how to find ways for you, your friends or your business to volunteer in the community, the United Way Suncoast is organizing a Week of Caring by pairing people with both in-person and remote volunteer opportunities. This is the 30th year United Way has organized its Week of Caring, which is staged in conjunction with Global Volunteer Month. They are hoping that anyone interested gets registered by March 25 in order to be paired with volunteer opportunities for the week of April 3-9. Individuals or groups of coworkers, friends or church members can sign up by emailing projects@uwsuncoast.org, or go to the website unitedwaysuncoast.org. The project will include opportunities in Hillsborough, Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota and DeSoto counties. They range from writing letters to seniors or teachers to helping load up food at Feeding Tampa Bay’s drive-through to neighborhood clean-ups. “Individually we are strong,” United Way’s release said, “but together we are united in teamwork and collaboration and are unstoppable in creating life-changing, exponential impact.”
