The Weeknd can’t seem to stay away from Raymond James Stadium. Just over a year after his Super Bowl halftime show performance, the pop singer will return to the venue as part of his upcoming “After Hours Til Dawn” stadium tour. Doja Cat will join the pop singer in Tampa on Aug. 4. Only one other Florida stop — Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium on Aug. 6 — is planned. The Weeknd had originally scheduled his “After Hours” arena tour for 2020, but the pandemic prompted him to push back the dates multiple times. He finally ended up canceling the tour and replacing it with the “After Hours Til Dawn” tour. Fans can expect to hear hits from the Weeknd’s newest records, 2022′s Dawn FM and 2020′s After Hours. According to a statement posted on the Weeknd’s website, fans who purchased tickets for the “After Hours” tour can access a presale starting on Friday. Tickets go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. on March 10.
