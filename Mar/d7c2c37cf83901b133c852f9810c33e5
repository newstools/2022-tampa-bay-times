JACKSONVILLE — Two former top executives at a city-owned utility company in north Florida have been charged with conspiring to steal millions of dollars from the city of Jacksonville through an attempt to sell the utility, according to a federal indictment unsealed Monday. Former JEA chief executive officer Aaron Zahn, 42, of Jacksonville Beach, and Former JEA chief financial officer Ryan Wannemacher, 40, of Santa Rosa Beach, were charged with wire fraud and conspiracy. If convicted on all counts, each could face up to 25 years in prison, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. According to the grand jury indictment, the top officials at the JEA worked together to devise a lucrative bonus plan that would have paid them millions of dollars if the city-owned utility were sold. In 2019, they falsely projected to the utility’s board that the JEA was in a “death spiral” that would lead to mass layoffs, rate hikes and reduced revenues unless it was sold or privatized, according to the indictment. Under one calculation, if the utility sold for $3 billion, Zahn, Wannemacher and other officials stood get tens of millions of dollars in payouts, the indictment said. Defense attorneys for Zahn or Wannemacher didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment from The Associated Press. According to the company website, JEA serves about 478,000 electric customers, 357,000 water customers, 279,000 sewer customers and 15,000 reclaimed water customers.
