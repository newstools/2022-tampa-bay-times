The Rays hit the road today for a 1:05 p.m. game against the Braves in nearby North Port. Lefty Shane McClanahan, who emerged as the Rays’ top starter last season, will make his first appearance of the spring, likely working into the second inning. McClanahan’s last outing, in the AL Division Series finale, did not go well. Also slated to make their spring debuts: relievers JT Chargois, J.P. Feyereisen, newcomer Brooks Raley and Matt Wisler. Also Wednesday: • Right-hander Luis Patino, who was scratched from a Tuesday start due to some arm discomfort, threw an 18-20 pitch bullpen in Port Charlotte and said he felt good. Patino said the issue was in the back of his shoulder, suggesting it was due to his offseason weightlifting routine and said he had no further concerns. He will throw a live batting practice on Saturday and, if all goes well, slot into his first game after that. • The team had a brief private ceremony in the morning to honor bullpen catcher Jean Ramirez, who died by suicide during the offseason, and installed a banner in his honor in the spring stadium bullpen. Ramirez’s parents traveled from Texas and spoke, as did Rays manager Kevin Cash and several staff members. The players will wear Ramirez’s No. 98 on Friday. There will be additional tributes in May as part of mental health Awareness month events. • Infielder Taylor Walls in a Twitter post aligned himself with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis against allowing transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports.
