Passover is a Jewish holiday commemorating the Hebrews’ liberation from slavery in Egypt. Because all leaven, whether in bread or other mixtures, is prohibited, Passover is also sometimes called the Festival of Unleavened Bread. This year, Passover is celebrated April 16-23. The following are a few ways we found to celebrate Passover in the Tampa Bay area. Model Matzah Bakery: Children ages 2 to 12 can enjoy a kosher lunch and snow cones before sifting flour, rolling dough and making their own matzah.
