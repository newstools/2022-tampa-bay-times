Planning to drive across the Sunshine Skyway Bridge on Sunday morning? St. Petersburg Police suggest finding another route. Northbound lanes will close from 3:30 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Sunday for the Skyway 10K, police say. At the annual race, walkers and runners will be able to cross Tampa Bay’s iconic bridge by foot after last year’s event was virtual only. Southbound lanes will remain open. The Skyway Bridge fishing piers will also be closed starting at midnight, race organizers said in a statement. The only access point for participants for the 6.2 mile course across the Skyway Bridge is from Tropicana Field. Some roads between the start/ finish line and Tropicana Field will be closed to the public for 10K bus transportation, organizers said. 4th Avenue South between Martin Luther King Jr. Street and 16th Street South won’t be open between approximately 3 a.m. to 11 a.m.
