Construction has begun on a Whole Foods Market in St. Petersburg. J Square Developers and SJC Ventures, partners on the supermarket development, began demolition and construction this week after receiving necessary permits for the work, according to a news release. The free-standing grocery store being built at 201 38th Ave. N is the first Whole Foods for the city. “Part of the early construction process will include rerouting an existing storm sewer line that runs right through the middle of the property, so passersby will see that happening first, plus demolition of the existing structures before going vertical,” said Jay Miller, CEO of J Square Developers in a statement. It’s unclear when the grocery store is slated to open. The plaza where the Whole Foods is being built includes a Suncoast Fitness, Kahwa Coffee and Dollar General. It’s near several grocery stores along St. Pete’s Fourth Street N thoroughfare, including two Publix stores, Trader Joe’s and The Fresh Market.
