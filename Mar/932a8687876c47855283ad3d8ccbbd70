Lightning coach Jon Cooper didn’t have a good feeling about Ryan McDonagh after the defenseman blocked a shot late in Thursday’s loss to the Bruins and missed most of the third period. His instincts were right, as McDonagh was ruled out indefinitely with an upper-body injury before Saturday’s game in Detroit. McDonagh has been one of the Lightning’s most stable blueliners this season, averaging 22:36 minutes per game, second among skaters to defenseman Victor Hedman (25:20). Saturday’s game was only the fourth he has missed this season. In addition to his team-leading 116 blocked shots, McDonagh has 21 points, including 18 assists. The top defense pair of Hedman and Jan Rutta remained intact during the game. Mikhail Sergachev moved up to join Erik Cernak on the second pair. Zach Bogosian and Cal Foote, who made his first start since March 10 at Calgary, comprised the third pair. Contact Mari Faiello at mfaiello@tampabay.com.
