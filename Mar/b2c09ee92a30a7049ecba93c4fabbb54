PALMETTO — A 7-year-old Florida boy walking with his dad after martial arts practice was killed when an intoxicated driver jumped the curb and struck them despite the father’s efforts to protect him, police said. The boy and his father had just left the martial arts studio Wednesday night when a van driven by 35-year-old Aaron Naylor jumped the curb, Palmetto police said. The father tried to push the boy out of the way, but he was struck and fatally injured. The father suffered minor physical injuries. Their names have not been released. Naylor is charged with DUI manslaughter and drug possession. He was being jailed late Thursday on $500,000 bail. Jail records do not indicate if he has an attorney.
