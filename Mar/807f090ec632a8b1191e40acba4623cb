VALRICO — A fifth grade teacher at Grace Community Church and School was arrested this week for having child pornography on his email account, the Hillsborough Sheriff’s Office said. Stephen Robb, 69, now faces six counts of possession of child pornography after a search of his email Tuesday revealed pornographic pictures of children. Also included was a photo of one of his current students fully clothed. Deputies say they received two cyber tips about Robb from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. The Pasco County Sheriff’s Office helped in Robb’s arrest, deputies said. Grace Community Church and School is a K-12 Christian school at 1300 N Valrico Road. The school’s website says it opened in 1975 and has a 100 percent college acceptance rate for its graduating seniors. Robb has been removed from an online list of teachers at the school.
