If you stepped outside and smelled smoke Wednesday morning, you’re not alone. Strong winds paired with dry air have led the National Weather Service to issue a “red flag warning” for Tampa Bay, meaning the region has a high risk of wildfires starting and spreading today. Some fires didn’t wait for sunrise to start burning, says WTSP, Ch. 10 meteorologist Grant Gilmore. He said some brush fires were already present in the early morning and that residents may smell smoke as a result. There is no chance of rain Wednesday and winds will be gusty throughout the day, said meteorologist Austen Flannery of the Weather Service’s Ruskin office. Making the threat of wildfires even more critical is a forecast high of 90 in Tampa. The Lakeland district of the Florida Fire Service, which includes Hillsborough and Pinellas counties, says it will not grant burn authorizations Wednesday. Gilmore said the organization is performing some controlled burns today to fend off larger wildfires. An air pollution precaution was issued for Hillsborough County in anticipation of an increase in unhealthy pollutants in the air, the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County said Tuesday. The Florida Panhandle was ravaged by wildfires earlier this month. The flames forced the evacuations of more than a thousand homes and burned at least 1,400 acres. On Florida’s east coast, meanwhile, low visibility caused by smoke from a prescribed burn — paired with morning fog — led to a crash on Interstate 95 that killed three this month. An incoming cold front on Thursday will quell any threat of wildfires in Tampa Bay to end this week. As for Wednesday, however, Flannery says the region must be cautious. “This is a day where fires can spread out of control,” he said.
