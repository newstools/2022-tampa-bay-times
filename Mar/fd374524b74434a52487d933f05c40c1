Jay Collins, one of four Republicans filed to challenge U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, has been admitted to the national Republican Party’s Young Guns program. The program, run by the party’s House campaign arm, is a way to showcase candidates the party believes can win. To qualify, candidates must reach benchmarks in fundraising, messaging and campaign viability; a party spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the qualifications. Collins said this is the first time the program has included a candidate in Castor’s heavily Democratic district. Its makeup could change with redistricting. Republicans Chris Chambers, James Judge and Angel Urbina are also filed in the race. Other candidates could be added to the program, and Judge said he hopes to be.
