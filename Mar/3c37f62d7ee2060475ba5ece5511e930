Bucs free-agent tailback Ronald Jones reportedly is set to land that elusive second NFL contract, albeit with shorter terms and in a different time zone. The first of the Bucs’ three second-round picks in 2018, Jones is set to sign a one-year deal with the Chiefs that could pay him up to $5 million, NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported Saturday. Jones ends his four-year tenure in Tampa Bay with 25 starts, 2,174 rushing yards (4.5 yards per attempt), 76 receptions and 19 total touchdowns. The fastest option out of the Bucs’ backfield (see his 98-yard scoring run at Carolina in 2020), Jones started the first 13 games of the 2020 season before landing on the reserve/COVID-19 list. That stint, and a quad injury moments before the wild-card game at Washington, opened the door for Leonard Fournette’s stunning resurgence. Fournette re-signed with the Bucs in 2021 and established himself as a three-down back and dependable pass-catcher. By contrast, Jones caught 76 of the 104 passes targeted to him in four seasons and struggled at times in pass protection. Five of his nine career drops came in 2020. The Bucs signed Fournette to a new three-year deal earlier this week and still have third-year back Ke’Shawn Vaughn under contract. They still could re-sign veteran Giovani Bernard or address the position in the draft. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
