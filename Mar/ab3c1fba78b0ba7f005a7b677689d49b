Lock out the owners MLB talks break off, first two series of regular season canceled | March 1 If you went and got the next 1,200 best major league league baseball players in the world, the play on the field — the product — would suffer greatly. If you handed MLB teams over to any 30 competent businesspeople, the sport would not suffer. Actually, it might improve. Paul Bacon, Hallandale Beach You have the vote Florida House Democrats, Republicans clash over ‘CRT,’ ‘don’t say gay’ bills | Feb. 23 To all those parents who think they have no say in the education of their children: You have the ultimate power — the power to vote for School Board members or to vote them out. Exercise this power. Carl Zielonka, Tampa Send them weapons ‘Freedom will always triumph over tyranny’ | March 2 The Ukraine people need firearms. I think it would be a democracy-defending gesture for the National Rifle Association to run a gun drive. Maybe it could coordinate with the American Legion and other organizations and collect and send the weapons to Ukraine so people could defend themselves from Russian domination. Arnold Amidon, Treasure Island Keep pressure on Putin ‘Freedom will always triumph over tyranny’ | March 2 It’s crystal clear to me now why Vladimir Putin had his military adventurism on hold while Donald Trump was in office. He was counting on Trump to splinter and divide NATO. But that did not happen. And yet, Putin thought that there would be no resolve from the West to react to his brutal miscalculation in invading Ukraine. He got that wrong. All Putin did was to solidify freedom-loving people’s resolve. Let’s keep up the pressure and ignore the Tucker Carlsons and Rand Pauls of the world. James Harazin, St. Petersburg
