TAMPA — A 33-year-old Clearwater man was killed Wednesday evening after he struck a guardrail with his car and it caught fire next to Interstate-4, the Florida Highway Patrol says. Troopers say the man lost control for unknown reasons around 7:10 p.m. near the interchange with I-75. The car left the roadway, entered the median and struck a concrete barrier, causing it to rotate, strike a guardrail and burst into flames. The man was taken to a hospital, where he later died. He was wearing a seatbelt.
